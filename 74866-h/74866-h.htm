tearing old letters.</i></p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> I am sure one might ask anyone to
an afternoon tea, even if anyone were
one’s old lover; and I am sure one might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>come to anyone’s afternoon tea, even
if anyone were one’s quondam sweetheart.
From both Harold’s stand-point
and mine, it seems to me perfectly safe.
Certainly the vainest man could not believe
that a woman wished to rake up the
leaves of a dead past because she sent
him an At-home from four to six card, for
a day when she is to be at home for two
hundred people besides. If it were an
evening party, now—in summer with the
lawn, or in winter with a conservatory—or
if there is not a conservatory there are
always stairs; and it’s daily more and
more the fashion to build them curved.
Another generation may find discreet recesses
at every landing. When people
are really thoughtful there will be a temporary
addition where people can go up
and down. Oh, if it was an evening
party I could not blame Harold for staying
away. Or if it was private theatricals—the
stage is itself one grand opportunity!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Or a picnic—what innumerable
openings for raking up the dry leaves of a
dead past on a picnic! But an afternoon
tea! Nothing stronger or dryer than tea-leaves
to be had. Harold need not be in
the least afraid. Besides, it would have
been really unfriendly not to send him a
card. Everybody knows he is at home
again, and from a four years’ trip. Even
after all that has passed I would not wish
to be unfriendly. Four years, and they
say that he is engaged to Mattie Montgomery—and
just before he went away
he was engaged to me. (<i>A little sadly.</i>)
Perhaps he was foolish. Perhaps—I was.
Undoubtedly we both were. I suppose I
ought to feel flattered that he waited four
years—but somehow I don’t—altogether;
“flattered” does not seem to be the word.
Well, it makes little difference now, and
it will make less when I tell him to-morrow
that I am engaged to Dr. Tennant.
I thought I might as well look over his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>letters. I have burned all but the last.
(<i>Takes up letter from the table.</i>) Here it
is. (<i>Takes up a second letter.</i>) And here
is Dr. Tennant’s first. Two models of
epistolary communication—but of different
orders. (<i>Reads.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>My Dear Miss Van Dyke</span>: I shall
give myself the pleasure of calling upon
you this afternoon at five o’clock. It rests
with you whether or not this pleasure is
to be intensified a hundredfold, or attended
with lasting pain. I remain always,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Yours most cordially,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>“<span class='sc'>Edward Tennant</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>What could be better suited to the circumstances
than that? Not too impassioned,
but sufficiently interested. I am
always affected by well-turned phrases—I
think this is charming. And here is
Harold’s. (<i>Reads other letter.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have made it plain enough.
There is no necessity for more words.
Heaven forgive you—and good-by.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>(<i>Thoughtfully.</i>) He was in a pretty passion
when he wrote that—and I have not
seen him since. I hope he will come to-morrow.
He used to think Mattie Montgomery
was a doll of a thing. Perhaps he
will tell her that I am a—no, he won’t.
Whatever I am, I’m not a doll of a thing,
and he knows it. (<i>Looks at the two letters
side by side.</i>) How amusing one’s old
flirtations look in the light of a new and
serious reality—for I have made up my
mind what to say to Dr. Tennant. It will
be rather good fun to tell Harold of it
confidentially to-morrow. I will drop it in
his tea with a lump of sugar. (<i>Glances at
clock.</i>) After four o’clock. Well, I must
go and make myself fascinating and give
orders that Dr. Tennant and I are not to
be disturbed. We may as well begin to
get used to <i>tête-à-têtes</i>. (<i>Exit after putting
the letters under a book, out of sight.</i>)</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c012'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Harold Whitney</span>. <i>He seems disturbed.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><i>H.</i> This is certainly confoundedly odd.
I expected to find fifty other people here
at least, and Esther in her best gown receiving
them. I can’t have mistaken the
hour. It is some time after four. There
is certainly a mistake somewhere, however,
and under the circumstances it is
likely to be a particularly awkward one.
I would walk a good mile and a half to
avoid a <i>tête-à-tête</i> with Esther Van Dyke.
Because I have been fool enough after
four years to remember the color of her
eyes, I don’t care to have her know it and
see it. I would leave now, like the historic
Arab, if I hadn’t been such an ass as
to give my card to the servant, and Esther
has seen it by this time. I would rather
face the music than give her the pleasure
of laughing at me for running away. But
what does it mean? I must—the blood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>curdles in my veins at the thought—I must
have mistaken the day! The Fate which
I have felt dogging my footsteps from the
cradle has at last laid hold upon me! I
have dreamed of getting to a place the
day before I was asked. I have loitered
irresolutely on door-mats. I have gone
slowly by and watched until I saw another
carriage go in, but I have never <i>done</i> it
before. And to have come to Esther Van
Dyke’s after four years, and such a parting,
a day too soon! My bitterest foe
would find it in his heart to pity me now.
What can I do? (<i>Walks around the room
and fingers things restlessly.</i>) I might go
off with the spoons to divert suspicion. I
would rather be arrested as a professional
burglar, entering the house under false
pretences, than witness Esther’s smile
when she comes to a realizing sense of
what I have done. Professional burglars
probably retain their self-respect. There
is no reason why they shouldn’t. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>date of <i>their</i> visit is not fixed by invitation.
But, confound it! there won’t be
any spoons until to-morrow. Perhaps she
won’t know I have come a day too soon—but
she always did know things—that was
the kind of person she was. (<i>Takes up a
book from the table.</i>) I might read to compose
my mind. “Familiar Quotations,”—I
wish I could find an elegant and appropriate
one for the occasion. I can
think of several, entirely familiar to the
most unlearned, but too forcible for a
lady’s drawing-room. “Too late I stayed”
would hardly do. I wonder what the
fellow would have sung if “Too soon
he’d come.” (<i>Throws down book.</i>) I
thought I could accept an invitation to an
afternoon tea, because I need only say a
word to her, see if she had changed, and
leave. That seemed safe enough. Besides,
Miss Montgomery chaffed me about
coming, and wouldn’t have hesitated to
make the most of it if I had stayed away.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>(<i>Looks about.</i>) The room has not changed
much. I wonder—here she is. Now, for
all I have learned in four years, I would
like to conceal myself in the scrap-basket,
but it is out of the question.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Esther</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> How do you do, Mr. Whitney? I am
very glad to see you. (<i>They shake hands.</i>)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> It is very good of you to say so,
Esth—Miss Van Dyke. (<i>Aside.</i>) I never
felt so fresh in my life.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> It was nice of you to think of coming
this afternoon instead of waiting until
the crush to-morrow, when I should have
an opportunity for no more than a word
with you.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>aside</i>). She does not <i>look</i> satirical.
Why didn’t I bring some flowers or something?
(<i>They sit. Aloud, with somewhat
exaggerated ease of manner.</i>) When one’s
hostess receives all the world, one’s own
reception cannot be a personal one. After
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>four years I wished for something
more positive. Perhaps I have been too
bold, but an afternoon tea is so very impersonal,
you know.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>a little embarrassed by his manner,
aside</i>). Can it be that he does not wish
our relations to be impersonal? Of course
not! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Yes, I know. Very impersonal
indeed. I was thinking the same
thing before you came.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>aside</i>). Yes, and I was thinking the
same thing before I came. We haven’t
either of us gotten on much. (<i>Aloud.</i>) I
was always an exacting sort of fellow, you
know, so you will not be surprised at my
coming to get a reception on my own account.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>aside</i>). I should think I did know.
(<i>Aloud.</i>) No, I am not surprised. (<i>A
moment’s pause—with a slight effort.</i>) So
you are an exacting sort of fellow still? I
am looking for the changes of four years,
you see.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span><i>H.</i> (<i>significantly</i>). You may not find
many, after all (<i>Somewhat gloomily.</i>)
The rose-color wears off one’s glasses
somewhat in four years, to be sure, but
I don’t think the perspective changes
much.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> Don’t you? It strikes me that time
reverses the glasses—that we find ourselves
suddenly looking through the other
end, and things that once were so large
are a long way off, and have become extremely
small.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>aside</i>). Which means, I suppose,
that I have taken a back seat, and must
keep at opera-glass distance. (<i>Aloud.</i>)
Things have no importance of their own,
then? I suppose it is a good deal a matter
of which way you look at it.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> Yes, education does everything for
us—which is something of a platitude.
But I am sorry about the rose-color. I’d
much rather you should look at me
through tinted glasses. I said the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>day to a confidential friend that my complexion
is no longer what it was.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>refusing to be diverted</i>). No, I do
not think one’s views of persons change—or
perhaps I should say one’s attitude
toward persons—as do those of abstractions.
One does not expect to find
truth—trust—honor—<i>love</i>, growing so
large.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>soberly</i>). In other words, truth is a
hot-house, and one’s ideas are tropical.
Well, it is perhaps as well to come out
into the open air, even if things do seem a
little—stunted—at first.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> Undoubtedly. Yet the comfort of
the human frame demands something in
the way of a temperate zone between. A
sudden plunge into the arctic regions is
apt to convey a chill—quite a serious one
sometimes.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>aside</i>). I wonder if that is meant
for a veiled allusion. (<i>Aloud.</i>) But nature
generally provides a way of softening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>matters, and makes such changes not
chilling, but bracing.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>carelessly</i>). Yes—Nature has been
much maligned in her time, but, after all
she is kinder than humanity in certain of
even its most attractive forms. She is impartial
and she contrives to let one down
easily. I am sometimes astonished that
Nature should be personified as a woman.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>looking away from him</i>). I see you
have become a cynic.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>with intention</i>). I have, perhaps,
lived up to my opportunities. They have
not been unfavorable to cynicism. (<i>Laughing.</i>)
Do you know, Esther, this is very
much the way we used to talk? We were
continually dealing in the most artistic
abstractions. How easily one drops into
old fashions!</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>aside</i>). How can he speak so lightly
of “the way we used to talk,” or is it
only I that remember? (<i>Aloud, coldly.</i>)
Possibly, but old fashions are very readily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>seen not to belong to the present day.
And yet—I may be mistaken—but it seems
to me that we used to talk in a way that
bordered on—on the concrete.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>a little nonplussed</i>). Yes—that is
true—but we were not so successful there.
(<i>Aside.</i>) Decidedly we did. On the very
concrete, indeed! And that was where
she always had the better of me. She is
quite capable of doing it again—but she
does not wish to.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>calmly</i>). But where were we in
our abstractions? Ah, with Nature. I
always get beyond my depth when Nature
is introduced into the conversation.
Human nature I do not mind at all, you
know, but Nature by itself frightens me.
I think it is the capital N. I feel that I
ought to go out-of-doors and appreciate
her.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> I remember you were always afraid
of getting beyond your depth. I was less
prudent, however, which was sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>unfortunate. (<i>Aside.</i>) I shall be floundering
again if I go on with this remembering.
(<i>Aloud.</i>) So you are still cautious?
I have not had the four years to myself.
Have they not changed <i>you</i> at all, Esth—Miss
Van Dyke?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>pensively</i>). Yes.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>with attention</i>). You are not quite
the same, then? I should not have known
it.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>with emphasis</i>). Wouldn’t you,
really?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> Unfortunately for me—no.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> No, I am not the same.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>in a low tone</i>). Will you tell me
how you have changed?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>after a pause</i>). I have grown stout!
Yes, I have. I have gained twenty
pounds in the four years you have been
away.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>laughing</i>). The inference pains
me deeply. But twenty pounds can be
judiciously distributed without actual injury
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>to the possessor. Is there anything
else?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>sentimentally</i>). Ah, yes, when I am
introduced to a new man I no longer expect
to find him a mine of entertainment.
I used to. Now I am surprised if I have
not to be clever for both of us.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> Is that so new? (<i>Thoughtfully.</i>) I
sometimes think I was stupid for both of
us—or—could it have been only that you
were too wise? (<i>Aside.</i>) Oh, this fatal
tendency to reminiscence—and I know
better!</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>with a slight effort</i>). You are carrying
me too far back. I am marking my
progress since I saw you. (<i>Aside.</i>) Certainly
this is too much like burrowing in
the leaves of a dead past. No wonder he
did not wait until to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> Forgive me, and go on with the disillusionments.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>
<img src='images/i_027.jpg' alt='[Couple]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span><i>E.</i> Sadder yet, I no longer care when a
younger and a fairer girl “cuts me out,”
to put it boldly. I think I shall, you
know, but I don’t. I sigh—but I forget
them—<i>both</i>!</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> This shows a callousness really
alarming. You might at least reserve
the guiltier party for future punishment.
Perfidy merits at least remembrance. It
is sometimes a man’s last hold.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>carelessly</i>). A man should risk little
on so commonplace a resource—if one
wishes to be remembered, one should be
unusual. Besides, you would imply that
the man is the guiltier party?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> Only as far as his lights are taken
into consideration, of course. Man is a
poor creature at his best—in comparison.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> And sometimes a comparatively innocent
one. To find another woman more
attractive is blamable, but to be a more
attractive woman ought to be unpardonable.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> “To err is human—fiendish to outshine.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>I understand. (<i>With marked politeness.</i>)
Permit me to suggest that it is
rarely——</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>laughing</i>). But I have said I have
lost my capacity for feeling thrusts of this
kind. (<i>In a lower tone.</i>) At least, I believed
that I had.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>dryly</i>). I was always a little unfortunate
in my attempts to make amends—always
too late, perhaps.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>meeting his eyes</i>). Yes, making
amends was never your forte.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> Any more than cherishing illusions
is yours. But, pray, go on with your revelations.
I must improve the unexpected
pleasure of finding you alone.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>a little embarrassed</i>). Whom, then,
did you expect to find here? (<i>Aside.</i>) He
cannot have known that Dr. Tennant is
coming. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Who would interfere,
did you think, with the personal welcome
you so desired?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>aside</i>). I was getting on so well.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>(<i>Lightly.</i>) Oh, party calls, you know,
and——</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>dryly</i>). You will find that <i>customs</i>
have not changed so much in four years. It
is still unusual to pay party calls in advance.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>aside</i>). That was a brilliant way to
recoup my falling fortunes! (<i>Boldly.</i>) Is
this an indirect way of blaming me for
coming this afternoon? (<i>Rising.</i>) I suppose
it was unwise. (<i>Aside.</i>) I should
rather think it was. (<i>Aloud.</i>) I will go
now—Esther.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>quickly</i>). You know, Harold, I did
not mean anything so rude. Do not go—unless
you must.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>aside</i>). I must—theoretically. But
I sha’nt—not after that “Harold.” If I
hadn’t prided myself for years on its being
inalienable property, I should say I was
losing my head. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Will you tell
me more of your four years?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>seriously</i>). Yes. I have grown wise.
I have grown hard—a little.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span><i>H.</i> (<i>softly</i>). You were hard before—a
little.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> Are they not the same—wisdom and
hardness? I have learned to believe that
they are.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>impulsively</i>). Not always.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> And I, too, have acquired the sense
of proportion. I have seen that—that—Love
is not all the world. I have learned
that the comfortable is more to be desired
than gold—yea, than fine gold.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> Yes; Gold and Love must both be
tried in the furnace, which is seldom a
comfortable operation.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> And you—do you not agree with
me? Is it not better to look on?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> So long as it is not at another’s
happiness that one has desired for one’s
self—yes.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>aside</i>). How if it be another’s unhappiness,
I wonder. Poor Dr. Tennant.
(<i>Sighs.</i>)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>aside</i>). I shall make an ass of myself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>in a moment. She is not changed an
atom. (<i>Aloud.</i>) But what leaves of wisdom
have you steeped for me? I expected a
cup of tea, and you have given me a decoction
that should heal all disappointments.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>half sadly</i>). If I had known I possessed
such a secret I should have brewed
some for myself before this. But (<i>rising</i>)
if you expected a cup of tea you shall
have it.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>eagerly</i>). By Jove! Esther! I beg
pardon—but Miss Van Dyke, I beg of
you—— (<i>Stops helplessly.</i>)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> I was just about to send for it for
myself. (<i>She rings. Aside.</i>) I see it all.
He has come a day too soon. And he
would have had me believe that he cared
to see me alone. And I was actually
growing sentimental. He shall pay for it.
(<i>Enter a maid.</i>) Tea, Mary Ann.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>who has been fidgeting about the
room—aside</i>). If only I had gone half an
hour ago—in the flush of triumph, as it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>were! It was unnecessary, in order to
avoid making a sentimental spectacle of
myself, to fall back upon the larder!</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>going back to table and taking up a
letter</i>). Do you know what I was doing
when you came this afternoon?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> Learning a new Kensington stitch?
Studying a receipt-book? Putting a man
out of his misery by letter? These are, I
believe, some departments of “woman’s
work.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> No, I was reading an old letter—one
by which a man put himself out of
misery. Your last letter, in fact.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> My last letter?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> Yes.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mary Ann</span> <i>brings in the tea, and as</i> <span class='sc'>Esther</span>
<i>moves things on the table, she hands him</i>
<span class='sc'>Dr. Tennant’s</span> <i>letter by mistake</i>. <span class='sc'>Harold</span>
<i>glances at it and looks up surprised,
but</i> <span class='sc'>Esther</span> <i>does not see him</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> Am I to read this?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> Certainly.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span><span class='sc'>Mary Ann</span> <i>leaves the room</i>. <span class='sc'>Esther</span> <i>busies
herself with the tea-things</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>having read the letter—stiffly</i>).
Very elegant penmanship.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>surprised but indifferently</i>). I had
not thought of that. (<i>A pause.</i>)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>glancing at the letter again</i>). I
fancy the writer did.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>coldly</i>). Possibly. (<i>Aside.</i>) Oh,
why did I show it to him? I would not
have believed he would be so hard.
(<i>Aloud.</i>) Rather a forcible style, I think.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> Stiff, rather than forcible, I would
suggest.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>with suppressed feeling</i>). Your criticisms
are less pointed than usual. If you
had said unnatural it might express your
meaning still better.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>a little irritated</i>). He is a fortunate
man who is able to express himself with
such justness and freedom from exaggeration.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span><i>E.</i> It seemed to me exaggerated at the
time.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>with mock admiration</i>). Oh, how
can you say so! It is positively Grandisonian—almost
Chesterfieldian. (<i>Aside.</i>)
And utterly detestable.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>almost with tears</i>). I was wrong to
fancy you would be interested in such a
trifle. Please give it back.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>politely, handing it to her</i>). Not at
all. Certainly, the writer deserves the
lasting happiness he refers to. (<i>Aside.</i>)
And I wish it were nothing to me—if he
gets it or not.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> What do you mean? Is this what
I gave you? Oh, dear! (<i>Much embarrassed.</i>)
It was the wrong one! Never
mind. Here is your tea.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>takes the cup, after a short pause</i>).
I feel as if I had forced myself into your
confidence.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> You need not. It was my own
stupidity, of course.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span><i>H.</i> (<i>tastes his tea</i>). Might I see the
other one?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> Yes. (<i>Gives it to him.</i>)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>reads it while</i> <span class='sc'>Esther</span> <i>watches
him</i>). Yes; well, I might have said more.
But that was enough.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> Yes, that was, as the children say,
a great plenty. Oh, I neglected your tea!
One lump, or two?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>thoughtfully</i>). One. I wonder if
it has?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> What has?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> Heaven.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> Heaven has what?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> Forgiven you.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> I think so, by this time. It doesn’t
bear malice. Cream?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> Yes—prussic acid—anything. Thank
you. You do not ask whether I have
or not.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> No. I understood you shifted the
responsibility once for all. (<i>Sipping her
tea.</i>)</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span><i>H.</i> Perhaps I did. It is generally once
for all with me.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> Is it? It is better to have all—for
once. It is broader. It is more liberal.
It is my motto.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> Yes. So it was then. I have heard
there is safety in numbers. (<i>Aside.</i>) If I
believed that, I should begin to repeat the
multiplication-table. I shall never be in
greater need of it.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> Not always.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>with an effort</i>). Possibly Sir
Charles Grand—I mean Mr. Edward
Tennant—may have a narrowing influence.
(<i>Aside.</i>) It is no use. I can’t be
discreet. Confound Mr. Edward Tennant!</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>innocently</i>). Perhaps. (<i>Drinks tea.</i>)
And so you are engaged to Mattie Montgomery?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>formally</i>). You do me too much
honor.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> Really! (<i>More coolly.</i>) That is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>pity. I hoped we might proffer mutual
congratulations. An exchange of compliments
is such a promoter of good feeling.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>more stiffly</i>). I see I have been remiss.
But I did not understand.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> No, it is not yet time—but I have
betrayed his confidence inadvertently.
To-morrow you must congratulate me.
To-morrow I shall tell you that I am engaged.
Let me give you another cup.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>rising</i>). No, one is enough. Once
ought always to be enough! But it seems
I am fated to have it twice! I know I am
incoherent—but never mind! It’s the
tea!</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>playing with her teaspoon a little
nervously</i>). And you have forgiven me?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> I do not know that I have. But
(<i>coldly</i>) whether I have or not is of course
only a personal matter.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>feebly</i>). Of course.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> And so you are to tell me to-morrow
that you are engaged? Might I ask you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>if, in taking this step, you were actuated
by a wish to obtain my forgiveness?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>laughing</i>). I expected you to ask
mine—for being engaged to Mattie Montgomery.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>sits</i>). Suppose this afternoon you
tell me about the—to be colloquial—the
happy man. And I will have some more
tea.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>looking into the sugar-bowl</i>). Well,
to tell the truth this afternoon—he doesn’t
happen—to be—colloquially—the happy
man.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>aside; walking about</i>). So that
note was written to-day. I did not see
the date. It is not yet five o’clock, and it
is not yet too late. I shall gain nothing
by getting rattled and making a fool of
myself. (<i>Aloud, coming back and holding
out his cup, into which</i> <span class='sc'>Esther</span> <i>drops
sugar as they speak</i>.) Have I then taken
his place?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>gravely</i>). No. He is (<i>lump</i>) conservative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>(<i>lump</i>) in his (<i>lump</i>) tastes
(<i>lump</i>). He takes (<i>lump</i>) no sugar (<i>lump</i>)
at all (<i>lump</i>) in his.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>who has been watching</i> <span class='sc'>Esther’s</span>
<i>face, and not her fingers, sets down his
cup hastily</i>). Seven lumps is a little radical.
Then you have forgotten all in four
years? (<i>Pacing the floor.</i>) Forgotten
what I, Esther, have been fool enough to
remember as if it had happened yesterday!
Who is it talks about woman’s constancy?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>aside</i>). Not I. But I am very much
afraid I shall begin to. Has the tea gone
to my head too?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>with much feeling</i>). The bitterest
lesson the four years have taught me,
Esther, is that one’s earliest lessons are
never unlearned. They have been kinder
to you.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>in a  tone</i>). Have they? Perhaps.
They have taught us both, however,
that it is not necessary to unlearn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>them; one can go on as if one had never
studied—old lessons.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> Or old letters? (<i>Coming nearer
and taking up the letter.</i>) But you did
care for me enough to keep this letter—to
read it over to-day—to give one thought
to old happiness in the presence of new?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>recovering herself with an effort</i>).
I thought enough of myself to keep it. It
is a mistaken theory that a woman keeps
old love-letters for the sake of the sender.
She keeps them because they are flattering—because
they—they sound nice. I
have lots more.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>offended</i>). And you were only weeding
them out to-day? Very well. That is
enough. No further words are necessary.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> Yes—so you said before (<i>glancing
at letter</i>), or something very like it (<i>Looking
into the teapot.</i>) There is no more
tea for us, and the lamp has gone out.
(<i>Looking about.</i>) And no matches—unless
you have one in your pocket.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span><i>H.</i> (<i>who has been thinking, moodily feels
in all his pockets</i>). I am very sorry—but
I cannot supply you with even the necessaries
of life.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> Never mind, I can light it from the fire.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>pushes the letters toward her</i>).
Make a lamplighter of one of these, and I
will light it for you.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Esther</span> <i>hesitates an instant, takes up one letter,
and then the other</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> Oh, use mine. It has failed to rekindle
a passion, but it may do for a teakettle.
It may as well be reduced to
ashes along with the rest of the poor little
love-story.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Esther</span> <i>turns her head a little away and
slowly twists both letters into lamp-lighters</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>aside</i>). I shall let all my hopes
burn in the flame with my letter. If she
uses that, I give her up. I shall know
she is not mine to give up. I have come
to the pass where folly is my only reason.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>She is twisting Dr. Tennant’s! But now
she is twisting mine. (<i>She rises to go to
the fire and he rises to do it for her.</i>)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> I prefer to do it myself.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>She returns with one burning, with which she
lights the lamp, and lays the other down on
the table. He takes it up eagerly.</i></p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> So, Esther, you did not burn it,
after all? (<i>Rising and coming toward
her.</i>) You did not care that the last of it
should go out in ashes?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>speaking lightly</i>). It was not that

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> How do you like your tea?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> It is a little—cloying.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>rising and moving about the room</i>).
A bad fault.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span><i>H.</i> (<i>dryly</i>). But fortunately an uncommon
one.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>with feeling</i>). I have made a great
many mistakes in my life—suffered a great
deal of unhappiness—because I have been
afraid of being cloying. (<i>Aside.</i>) Am I
mad, that I should tell him the foolish
truth!</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>rising</i>). I should say it was a fault
to which you were not constitutionally
inclined. (<i>Aside.</i>) That sounds much
firmer than I feel.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> No, but on that very account people
should have borne with me more
than they have! (<i>Still with feeling.</i>)
Things might have been different.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>going toward her</i>). Esther! (<i>A bell.</i>)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>hurriedly</i>). Never mind! There
is the door-bell! Things are going to be
different! (<i>With a faint smile.</i>) I told
you he did not like any sweet at all in his.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>impetuously</i>). And have I not had
my full allowance of bitter? It is time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>you began dispensing sweets—so let him
stay away.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>laughing nervously</i>). But—but it
wasn’t my idea to get rid of him.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> The plan is ready for your acceptance.
You were going to tell me you

instead!</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>glancing at clock</i>). I cannot. His
engagement was made with me a week
ago.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> And mine five years ago. (<i>She hesitates.</i>)
Besides, he is late—half an hour
late. What is it about a lover who is
late? He has divided his time into more
than “the thousandth part of a minute.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> (<i>laughing</i>). And are you not later—by four years?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>firmly</i>). I am twenty-four hours

<p class='c009'><i>A knock. Enter maid with a card.</i></p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> Show him into the reception-room.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>I will come in a moment. (<i>Exit maid.</i>)
It is he, Harold. I must go.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>taking her hands</i>). Esther, think
one moment. Forget the four years. I
have come a day too soon. I have swallowed
two cups of tea and eight lumps of
sugar and made a general ass of myself—but—I
love you.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> But—but this is so shameless! I
thought I should have to say—something
like that—to him.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> (<i>coolly</i>). And I am in time to save
you from so unfortunate a mistake. You
had much better tell it to me.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> But I must give him an answer.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>H.</i> Give me one first! Adopt my plan,
it is so simple. Send word—or tell him,
if you like—that you are engaged. But
come back!</p>

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> Indeed, he shall have his answer
first. His right demands precedence at
least. But (<i>opening the door</i>) I will come

<p class='c010'><i>E.</i> Perhaps. (<i>Returns just as she is

<p class='c011'>Philander Atkinson, bachelor of
law and writer of light verse, sat one
murky August evening in his hall-bedroom,
with the gas turned low, wondering
whether the night would be too hot for
sleep. At a quarter before ten a loitering
messenger-boy brought him a line from
his friend Darnel: <i>Come around at once.
Just back. The very greatest news.</i>
Thereupon Atkinson discarded his smoking-jacket,
reluctantly exchanged his slippers
for shoes, and took the car down to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Twelfth Street, remembering meanwhile
that Darnel’s brief vacation from the
Broadway Bank expired that day, and
speculating as to the nature of the great
news which the clerk had brought back
from Vermont. The lawyer was a Vermonter
too, and it was this fact, as well
as a common literary ambition, that had
drawn the young fellows together at first,
long before Philander, on the strength of
having two triolets paid for, had moved up
to Thirty-first Street. Philander Atkinson
liked Darnel, admired his feverish energy
and his pluck, envied his acquaintance
with books. He had always persisted
in thinking that Darnel’s stories would
sell, if only some magazine would print
one for a starter; and he had patiently
listened to most of these stories, and to
some of them several times over. Yet
Darnel had never had any luck; had
never had even his deserts; and the sincerity
of his congratulations whenever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>Atkinson’s verses saw the light always
caused Philander to feel a trifle awkward.
He knew that the indefatigable clerk had
two or three manuscripts “out”—out in
the mails—when the vacation began, and
as he turned in at Darnel’s boarding-house
he had almost persuaded himself
that <cite>The Æon</cite> had accepted “Laki,” his
friend’s Egyptian story. It was a long
climb up to Darnel’s room, and the writer
of light verse mounted deliberately, being
fat with overmuch sitting in his office
chair. On the third floor the air was
heavy with orange-flowers and Bonsilene
roses, and a caterer was carrying away
ice-boxes. A whimsical rhyme came into
Philander’s head, and he made a mental
note of it. Just then Darnel appeared,
leaning over the balustrade of the fourth-floor
landing, his coat off, his collar visibly
the worse for the railway journey, and an
eager smile upon his thin, homely face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hullo, D.,” said Philander. “Here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>I am. Been having a wedding here?”
he added in a low voice, as he grasped
Darnel’s hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe so. I’m just back. Come
in, Phil. You got my message?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why else should I be here, old fellow?
Is it ‘Laki,’ sure?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Without answering, Darnel led the way
into his tiny room. His trunk lay upon
the floor, half-unpacked, the folding-bed
was down, for the better accommodation
of some of the trunk’s contents, and the
desk in the corner, under the single jet of
gas, was covered with piles of finely torn
paper. Darnel’s manner, usually nervous
and somewhat conscious, betrayed a certain
exhilaration, but he was under perfect
self-control.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Laki?’” he said, seating himself in
his revolving chair and whirling around
to the desk, while Atkinson threw himself
upon the bed, “‘Laki?’ Oh, I had forgotten.
It’s probably here.” He pulled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>over the mail accumulated during his absence.
“Yes.” He tore open the big
envelope. “‘The editor of <cite>The Æon</cite> regrets
to say,’ etc.;” and he tossed the
printed slip, with the manuscript, into his
waste-basket, with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c010'>Atkinson’s heart sank. Poor Darnel;
it was not a cheerful welcome home.
But Darnel was busied with his letters.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And here are the others,” he went on.
“I thank the Lord none of them were accepted.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What!” exclaimed Philander, turning
upon his elbow.</p>

<p class='c010'>Darnel looked at him with a puzzling
smile.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s why I sent for you,” said he.
“Phil, all that I’ve been writing here for
three years is stuff, and I’ve only just
found it out. I can do something different
now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Atkinson stared. Darnel had rarely
talked about his own work, and then in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>scarcely suppressed fever of excitement
and anxiety. Many a time had Atkinson
noticed his big hollow eyes turn darker,
and his sallow face grow ashy, even in
reading over with a shaking voice some
of that same “stuff.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have learned the great secret,” Darnel
added, quietly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have Aladdin’s ring?” said Atkinson.
“Or are you in love?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Both,” replied Darnel. “It is the
same thing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Philander flung himself back upon the
pillow, with a little laugh. “Go ahead,
D.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have found her, and myself. Let
me turn down the gas a little; I see it
hurts your eyes. I belong in the world
now; I am in the heart of it—I said to
myself coming down the river this afternoon—in
the heart of the world.” He
lingered over the words. “Phil,” he exclaimed,
suddenly, “all the time I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>trying to write I was really trying to lift
myself by the boot-straps. I was laboring
to imagine things and people, and to
get them on paper. It was all wrong.
Do you remember that French poem you
read me last winter, about the idol and
the Eastern princess—how she lay on her
couch sleeping—the night was hot—with
the bronze idol gazing at her with its porphyry
eyes, while her brown bosom rose
and sank in her sleep, and the porphyry
eyes kept staring at her—staring—but
they never saw? Well, I believe my eyes
have been like that. In ‘Laki,’ now, you
know I wanted to describe the exact color
of the stone in the quarry, and asked the
Egyptologist up at the Museum to tell
me what it was? He laughed at me.
Very well. It was a dull-red stone, with
bright-red streaks across it; I saw the
same thing in Troy this afternoon, when
a hod-carrier fell five stories and they
picked him up from a pile of bricks.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>“You’re getting rather realistic,” muttered
Philander. Darnel was not looking
at him, and went on unheeding.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have but to tell what I see. I have
stopped imagining; my head has ached—Phil,
you don’t know how it has ached—trying
to imagine things. I am past that
now; if you only shut your eyes and look,
it is all easy. Take that old Edda story
that I tried to work up, about the fellow
who fought all day long against his bride’s
father, and when night came the bride
stole out and raised all the dead men on
both sides, by magic, so that the next
day, and every day, the battle raged on
as before. I used to plan about the
magic she used, and tried to invent a
charm. Why, all she did was to pass over
the battle-field at night, where the dead
lay twisted in the frost, and while the
wolves snarled around her and the spray
from the fiord wet her cheek, she stooped
to touch the dead men’s wrists; and they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>loosed their grip upon broken sword and
split linden shield, their breath came
again, soft and low like a baby’s, and so
they slept till the red dawn.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look here,” said Atkinson, sitting up
very straight, “you’ve been reading ‘The
Finest Story in the World,’ and it has
turned your head.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, the London clerk who was conscious
of pre-existences, and forgot them
all when he fell in love? I could have
told Rudyard Kipling better than that
myself.” Darnel gave an impatient whirl
to the revolving chair.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You mean you think you can,” replied
Atkinson, sharply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“As you like.” He spoke dreamily,
and Atkinson dropped back on the pillow
again, watching his friend as narrowly as
the dim light would allow. Hard work
and unearthly hours had told on Darnel;
he certainly seemed light-headed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sickening heat—black frost—” he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>murmuring; “marching, stealing, fighting,
toiling—joy, pain—the life of the race—is
a man to grow unconscious of these things
in the moment that he really enters the
life of the race, that he feels himself a
part of it? What do you think, Phil?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think,” was the slow reply, “that
whatever has happened to you in Vermont
has shaken you up pretty well, old
fellow. They say that when someone
asked Rachel how she could play <i>Phèdre</i>
so devilishly well, she just opened her
black Jewish eyes and said, ‘I have seen
her.’ And I think, in the mood you’re in
now, you can see as far back as Rachel
or anybody else. It’s like being opium-drunk;
if you could keep so, and put on
paper what you see, you could beat Kipling
and all the rest of them. But you
can’t keep drunk, and you can’t write prose
or verse on love-delirium. It’s been tried.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Suppose Rachel had said, ‘I <i>am
Phèdre</i>?’”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>Atkinson lifted his stout shoulders,
laughing uneasily. “So much the worse.
I should say, the less pre-existence of that
sort the better. You might as well tell me
the whole story, D. What is her name?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In a moment. She loves me, Phil.
She is waiting for me in her little house
among the hills. I left her only this
morning, and soon I shall go back and
leave New York forever. I can write the
story up there—the story I have dreamed
of writing—for I shall always have the
secret of it. I have but to shut my eyes
and tell what I see; and it is because she
loves me. All the life of all the past—I
can call that ‘A Story of the Road.’
Then there will be the future to write of—the
men and women that are to come;
for we shall have children, Phil, and in
them——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re making rapid progress,” ejaculated
Philander.</p>

<p class='c010'>“——I shall know the story of the future.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>Even now I know it; I do not simply
foresee it, I see it. Why not ‘A
Story of the Goal!’ For I belong to it—do
you not understand? Yet, after all,
what is that compared with the present?
It shall be ‘A Story of the March!’
Look there!”</p>

<p class='c010'>He threw his eyes up to the ceiling,
which was brightened for an instant by
the headlight of an elevated train as it
rushed past.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you know what that engineer was
really thinking of as he went by? That
would be story enough. Or what was in
the heart of the bride to-night, down on
the third landing—you smelled the
orange-flowers as you came up? To feel
that your heart is in them, and theirs in
you——”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Philander Atkinson was not listening
to the lover’s rhapsody. He was
thinking of a certain summer when he,
too, had had strange fancies in his head;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>when his thoughts played backward and
forward with swift certainty; when he had
grown suddenly conscious of great desires
and deep affinities, and for a space of some
three months he had dreamed of being
something more than a mere verse-maker,
a master of the file. Then—whether it
was that she grew tired of him, or they
both realized that some dull mistake had
been made—it was all over. There was
still in his drawer a package of manuscript
he had written that summer; in blank
verse, none too noble a form for the high
thoughts which then filled him; in a queer
new rhythm, too, the secret of whose beat
he had caught at and then lost, for the
lines read harshly to him now. He looked
these things over occasionally, as a sort
of awful example of himself to himself;
though he had gone so far as to borrow
some of their imagery, not without a
certain shame, to adorn his light verse.
His card-house had fallen, but some of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>the colored pasteboard was pretty enough
to be used again. Curiously, he found
that he could cut pasteboard into more
ingenious shapes than ever since his brief
experience in piling it; fancy served him
better after imagination left him; his triolets
were admirably turned, and his luck
with the magazines began. Altogether it
had been an odd experience; half those
crazy ideas of Darnel had been his two
years before, but he was quite over them—yes,
quite—and now it was D.’s turn.
He listened again to something that Darnel
was murmuring.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And she is an ordinary woman, one
would say; a common woman. That is
the mystery and the glory of it. I do not
know that she is even beautiful. There
must be thousands of women like her; I
can see it plainly enough, that there must
be thousands of women in the world like
<i>her</i>.” There was a reverent hush in his
voice.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>
<img src='images/i_065.jpg' alt='[Woman]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Atkinson choked back an exclamation.
Was D.’s head really turned? “A common
woman”—“not know whether she is
beautiful?” A face rose before him, unlike
any face in all the world: eyes with
the blue of Ascutney, when you look at it
through ten miles of autumn haze; hair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>brown as the chestnut leaf in late October;
mouth——</p>

<p class='c010'>Philander trembled slightly, and rising
to his feet, stood looking down at Darnel,
haggardly. It was quite over, that experience
of two summers before, but while it
lasted he had at least never dreamed that
there were thousands of women in the
world like <i>her</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sit down, Phil, I am almost through.
A woman like other women, and the
story, when I write it, a common story.
It will be the commonest possible story;
common as a rose, common as a child. I
am going back to Vermont, where I was
born, and where I have been born anew.
There will be plenty of time for the story—years,
and years, and years. I have
only to close my eyes some day, and she
will write down all I tell her, and I shall
call the story hers and mine.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Atkinson still stood, his hands in
his pockets, his heavy figure stooping, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>lines hardening in his face, while he
watched the rapt gaze of Darnel, and
drearily reflected how strange it was that
a woman should open all the gates of the
wonder-world to one man’s imagination,
and that some other woman should close
those secret gates, quietly, inexorably,
upon that man’s friend.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wait,” said Darnel. “Must you go
back to your triolets? Let me show you
her picture first.” He turned the gas up
to its fullest height, and held out a photograph.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the same woman.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>: It is with some hesitation
that I venture to trespass upon your valuable
time, knowing as I do that the
demands of clients, of constituents, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>friends, are so exacting. Still, as what I
am about to ask relates to a matter lying
very near my heart, I hope you will forgive
me. A young man in whom, in spite
of the usual extravagances and follies of
youth, I discern some promise, and whom
I hope, for his own sake and from my
friendship for his excellent father, dead
long ago, to see occupying a respectable
position in the community, has, with the
heedlessness peculiar to his age, involved
himself in certain difficulties which, although
at present of a sufficiently distressing
nature, may, I hope, be satisfactorily
overcome. Knowing so well your distinguished
abilities, ripe judgment, and
great experience, I can think of no one to
whom I can, in this critical period of his
life, more confidently send him for counsel,
instruction, and aid, and I accordingly
commend him to you, trusting to our
old friendship to account for and excuse
my somewhat unusual act. Though what
I ask of you is something not usually required
of a lawyer, I think you will understand
my reason for thus troubling you.
No one can have a more thorough knowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>of the world than an old practitioner
like yourself, and what you may say must
fall upon the ears of youth with weighty
authority. Talk to him as you would to
your son, if you had one, not as to a
client, and I will be inexpressibly indebted
to you, for I know you will lead
him to appreciate the serious realities of
life, which, at present, he is so disposed
to disregard.</p>

<p class='c010'>I need only add that he is a young man
of some fortune, and, certainly, by birth
worthy of much consideration. He will
call upon you in person and himself explain
his present embarrassments.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>This was the letter that the Honorable
Jacob Maskelyne read, reread, and read
yet again. Indeed, not content with its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>repeated perusal, he turned it this way
and that, looked at it upside and down,
and finally, laying it upon the table, he
held up its envelope in curious study, as
people so often do when thus perplexed.
It bore the common, dull-red two-cent
stamp and was post-marked the day before.
Both it and the letter were apparently
as much matters of the every-day
world as a jostle on the sidewalk.
Nevertheless, the old lawyer was more
than puzzled—more than puzzled, although
he, of all men in the great, wideawake
city, would in popular opinion
have been thought perhaps the very last
to be thus at fault. If millstones were to
be worn as monocles—if there was any
seeing what the future might bring forth—the
chances of a project, the risks of rise
or fall in a stock, the hazards of a corner
in a staple, the prospects of a party or of
a partisan, Jacob Maskelyne would be regarded
as the man of men for the work.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>But, under the circumstances, even to him
this letter was more than perplexing.
Here, on this spring morning, with floods
of well-authenticated sunshine pouring
into every nook and corner, dissipating
every mystery of shadow and, it might
seem, every shadow of mystery—here, in
his office, bricked in by the unimaginative
octavos of the law—those hide-bound
volumes, heavy literature of all things
most amazingly matter of fact; here, in
the eighteen hundred and eighty-seventh
year of the Christian era, in the one hundred
and eleventh year of the Republic,
he had received a letter from his old
guardian, whom, when he himself was not
more than twenty, he remembered walking
about a feeble old man with many
an almost Revolutionary peculiarity in
speech and manner, and whose funeral
he, with the heads and scions of most of
the first families of the town, had attended
full twenty-five years ago. It certainly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>was enough to bewilder anyone. He
again took up the letter. It was unquestionably
in old Bevington’s best style,
courtly enough, but a trifle pompous.
Had it not been for its true tone he would
undoubtedly have thought the thing a
hoax and immediately have dismissed it
from his mind. He touched a hand-bell,
and in response a young man—a very prosaic
young man—over whose black clothes
the gray of age had begun to gather, appeared.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_076.jpg' alt='[Man]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>“Bring me the letters received of the
year eighteen sixty—letter B,” said the
lawyer, sharply.</p>

<p class='c010'>That was the year in which his father’s
estate had been finally settled, and he
knew that there would be many examples
of his guardian’s handwriting in the correspondence
of that time.</p>

<p class='c010'>The clerk soon returned with a tin case,
and laid it on the table. Mr. Maskelyne
took one from among the many papers
therein, and, striking it sharply against
the arm of his chair, to scatter the dust
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>that invests all things in the garment the
outfitter Time warrants such a perfect fit,
he spread it out beside the letter he had
just read with such blank wonder.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Identically the same,” he muttered.
“No other man ever made an <i>e</i> like
that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The clerk had vanished and the lawyer
was again alone.</p>

<p class='c010'>He glanced once more at the mysterious
missive, and then, with the purposelessness
of abstraction, he rose and went to
the window. Nothing caught his eye but
the sign-bedecked front of the opposite
building and one small patch of blue sky—near,
gritty, limestone fact and a faraway
something without confine. Still,
amazed as he was the contagious joy of
the time sensibly affected him.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>
<img src='images/i_079.jpg' alt='[Bridge]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The sparrows, quarrelsome gamins of
the air, for the time reformed by honest
labor into respectable artisans, upon an
opposite entablature, in garrulous amity
plied their small, nest-making
joinery. The
sunlight falling through
a haze of wires, wrought
into something bright
with its own glow a tuft
of grass which clumped
its spears in its fortalice,
taken in assault, on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>opposite frieze. Of even these small
things, and of much more, Mr. Maskelyne
was partially conscious. But the letter!
Clear-sighted as he was, he knew
but little—so forthright was his look, so
fixed toward mere gain—of the wonderful
country which lies beneath every man’s
nose, less even of the vanishing tracts
which retrospection sometimes sees over
either shoulder. But the letter! It peopled
his vision with things long gone. It
brought into view old Bevington—“Dick
Bevington,” as he was called to the last
day of his life—and a nickname at fifty
indicates much of character; brought up
before him Dick Bevington as he was before
age had stiffened his easy but dignified
carriage or taught his once polished
but positive utterance to veer and haul in
sudden change; brought up old Bevington,
as he himself, in childhood, had seen
him, stately but debonair, the perfection
of aristocratic exclusiveness, affable, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>in the genial kindliness of a kind-hearted
man secure in every position—a
genuine Knickerbocker in every practice
and in every principle—a well-born, well-bred
gentleman. And that once active
and once ebullient life had long ago gone
out! It almost seemed that such vitality,
so held in self-contained management, so
wisely put forth, so well invested, so to
speak, should have lasted forever. But
now there was nothing left to bring him to
mind but a portrait in the rooms of the
Historical Society, or a name in the list of
directors when the history of some bank
was given, or in the pamphlet in which
the story of some charitable institution
was told from the beginning—really there
was nothing more than this to recall Dick
Bevington, foremost among the city’s fathers,
the leader of the <i>ton</i>. When he
had last seen his guardian he had thought
him of patriarchal age. And was not he
himself now nearly as old? In spite of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>the blithesome aspects of the morning,
Jacob Maskelyne turned away from the
window with an unwonted weight at his
heart and a new wrinkle on his brow.
The whole world seemed to be going
from him, losing charm and significance
in a sort of blurring dissatisfaction, as
upon a globe, when swiftly turned, lines
of longitude and of latitude, and even
continents and seas, vanish from sight,
and all because his own life suddenly
seemed but vexed nothingness. He had
not even mellowed into age as had Bevington.
He was as sharp and as rough-edged
as an Indian’s flint arrow-head, and
he knew it.</p>

<p class='c010'>He seated himself at his table. Automatically
he was about to take up the first
of several bundles of law-papers, when he
was startled by the entrance of the clerk.
He leaned back in his chair, and his reawakened
wonder grew the more when
a card was placed before him upon which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>was written, in a dashing hand, “From
Mr. Bevington.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A gentleman to see you,” said the
clerk.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What does he look like?” asked Mr.
Maskelyne, suspiciously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nobody I ever saw before,” answered
the clerk; “and he seems rather
strange about his clothes,” he added, in
a rather doubtful, tentative manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let him come in,” said Mr. Maskelyne,
after a moment’s pause.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>
<img src='images/i_084.jpg' alt='[Man]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The door had hardly closed upon the
vanishing messenger when it again swung
upon its hinges, and a new figure stood
in relief against the clearer light from
without. In his eagerness to see of what
nature a being so introduced might be,
Mr. Maskelyne turned his chair completely
around, and silently gazed at
the new-comer as he entered. His eyes
fell upon a slim, graceful young man
dressed in the mode of at least forty-five
years ago—a mode not without its own
good tone undoubtedly, but with a tendency
toward gorgeousness which
an exquisite of these days of assertive
unobtrusiveness
might
think almost vulgar.
His whole
attire was touched
in every detail with
that nameless
something which
really makes the
consummate result
unattainable
by any not born
to such excellence;
but in the
bright intelligence
shining in his dark
eyes and the clear
intellectual lines
of his face, even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Maskelyne could see that if he had given
much thought to his dress it was only from
a proper self-respect, and not because
dress was the ultimate or the best expression
of what he was. Few could look into
the luminous countenance and not feel a
glow of sudden sympathy with the high aspirations,
the pure disinterestedness, the
clear intellect, that lit up and strengthened
his features. Even the old lawyer, disciplined
as he was by years of hard experience
to disregard all such misleading
impulses, felt his heart warm toward the
young man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope,” said the new-comer, with a
smile so pleasant, so ingenuous, so confiding,
that all Maskelyne’s ideas of deception—had
he had time to recognize
them in the moment before a strange,
unquestioning acquiescence took complete
possession of him—were at once
dissipated, “that I do not intrude too
greatly on your time.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Won really in spite of himself by the
appearance of his visitor, the famous
counsellor waved his hand toward a chair.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose,” continued the stranger,
with an almost boyish sweetness, as he
seated himself, “that Mr. Bevington has
already told you why I am here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Maskelyne might very well have
answered that Mr. Bevington was hardly
to be looked to for any information on
any subject, but he did not—the wonderful
circumstances of the interview had
been so driven from his mind by the potent
charm of the young man’s personality.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr.”—and he paused as if waiting
for enlightenment as to the name of the
stranger.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m in a devil of a scrape,” continued
the young man, apparently imagining
that the letter had made all necessary explanations,
and mentioning the devil as
though he was an every-day acquaintance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>a pleasant fellow whom he had just
left at the door awaiting his return.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah!” murmured the lawyer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did not wish to see you,” continued
the other, his singularly trustful smile
breaking again over lip and cheek.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indeed,” said Maskelyne, his wits
and perceptions in most confusing entanglement.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” went on the unaccountable visitor.
“I supposed that you would give
me what the world calls good advice.
But I don’t want that. I want to hear
something better.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He laughed aloud in such a joyous,
cheery fashion that the old lawyer even
smiled.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t think I am a good man to
come to for bad advice?” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The last in the world. I don’t suppose
that you ever did a foolish thing in
your life.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And therefore am perhaps less competent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>to advise others who have,” replied
Maskelyne, half heedlessly, for his
thoughts were slowly turning in a new
direction. The more he looked the more
the eager, spirited face seemed familiar.
He had certainly seen the young fellow
before, but where? It seemed to him
that he could certainly remember in a
moment, if he only had time to think.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Bevington——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pardon me,” interrupted Maskelyne,
in a significant tone, “you said Mr. Bevington?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly,” said the stranger, suddenly
looking up in evident surprise.
“Didn’t he write?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have received a letter,” said the
old lawyer, cautiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was on the point of making some
further inquiries, but the impulse came
to nothing. The former feeling of acquiescent
but expectant apathy again
possessed him; indeed, he had never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>been much in the habit of asking questions.
He knew that he often learned
more than was suspected even, by letting
people talk on in their own way.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the first place,” and he paused a
moment—“I am very much in debt.”
The young man spoke as he might of
taking a cold asleep in the open air—as
if he had been exposed to debt and had
caught it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first look of sadness rose and
deepened over his face as he shook his
head dejectedly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I’ll get over it—‘Time and I.’
Don’t you rather like the astute old king
after all, Mr. Maskelyne?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“By your own exertions?” asked the
lawyer, dryly, and evading the question.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I write a little,” replied the impenitent,
modestly. “I have even heard of
people who admired some of my verses.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have no other occupation?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Old Maskelyne was asking enough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>questions now. Indeed, under the magic
of the stranger’s manner he had quite
forgotten himself, his usual caution, and
even the exceptional manner in which his
companion had been introduced to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” the other admitted, “I am a
lawyer.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t you think,” said the older man,
answering almost instinctively, “that on
the whole you might find the employments
of the law more remunerative than
the calling of a—poet?”</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/i_091.jpg' alt='[Algebra]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Maskelyne, I sometimes think
that the world really believes in the sort
of thing underlying your question—that
there is wisdom in what it so complacently
repeats as indisputable. And I am
sent here phrase-gathering—to carry off
small packages of words put up in little
flat, portable sentences, alternatives ready
for daily use. But there are gains you
cannot invest in lands and stocks—columns
with statues at the top as well as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>columns whose sums are at the bottom.
Wasn’t ‘Le Barbier’ a better investment
than any in Roderigue Hortales et Cie.,
and what could John Ballantyne &#38; Co.
show beside ‘Guy Mannering?’ If the
world says what it does, it mustn’t do as
it does. It’s inconsistent. Who will undertake
to strike the balance between
fame and fortune; what mathematician
will undertake to say that <i>x</i>, the unknown
quantity of fame, does not equal the
dollar-mark?” Then he added, after a
moment’s pause,
“Mr. Maskelyne,
don’t you think it is
true that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘One crowded hour of glorious life,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is worth a world without a name,’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>don’t you really?”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was hard to resist
such enthusiasm,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>such unquestioning certainty. The old
lawyer did not even smile as he lay back
in his chair, a new life shooting through
every nerve, his gaze fixed on the flushing
face of the young man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And the consciousness of best employing
the best that is in you,” he continued.
“Who dare shorten the reach
or blunt the nicety of man’s wit, make
purblind the imagination, stiffen the cunning
hand? Tell men that in some Indian
sea, fathoms deep, lie hid forever
Spanish galleons in which doubloons and
moidores, as when honey more than fills
the comb, almost drip from their sacks,
and you will see in their sudden thoughtfulness
how quickly they appreciate such
loss; tell them, if you can, what, through
poverty, erring endeavor, uncongenial
occupation, the world with each year
loses in intellectual riches, and they will
stand heedless.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Speaking with the incomparable confidence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>of youth, its own glorious nonsense,
the young man’s voice sent old Maskelyne’s
blood hastening through his veins
in almost audible pulsations.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What if I do not wish great wealth,”
the speaker continued, “must I be made
to have it? I want but little. Give me
food, clothing, habitation, sufficient that
my eyes may see the delights this world
has to show, that my ears may catch the
whispered harmonies of all things beautiful,
gladden me with the radiance of common
joy, and that’s all I want. Who is
unreasonable when what he wants is all
he wants? Are the worldly so insecure
that, as the frightened kings sought to
still beneath their tread the first throb of
the French Revolution, they must stamp
out the first symptom of revolt against
the almighty dollar?</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘<span lang="it">Chi si diverte di poco, è ricco di molto.</span>’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Maskelyne, must I eat when I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>only thirsty, drink when I am only hungry?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He paused, and glanced triumphantly
at the old man. He felt in some secret,
instinctive way that he was gaining
ground. A squadron of fauns had
charged from amid the vine-leaves, and
the legion upon the highway was in rout.
Fine sense was victorious for the moment
over common sense.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think,” said Maskelyne, at last, and
with a strange, sad, patient air, unwearied,
however, by the young man’s dithyrambic,
sometimes almost incoherent speech,
“I think I cannot attempt to advise you.
Having discarded the wisdom of ages,
what heed will you give the wisdom of
age?”</p>

<p class='c010'>A cloud seemed to cast its shadow over
the other’s face. Could it be that, lost
in himself, he had spoken almost in presumptuous
disrespect to a man so distinguished,
to a man whom he honored
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>and whom he felt that he could even
like?</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I speak strongly,” he said, “it is
because I feel strongly. If I did not feel
strongly I would not attempt to withstand
the amount of testimony against
me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Might I ask,” said Maskelyne, gently,
in his inexplicable sympathy with the
young fellow, “why, if you feel such confidence
in all you say, you do not, without
hesitation, enter on a life in accordance
with your convictions?”</p>

<p class='c010'>At last there was hesitation in the young
stranger’s manner. He turned his hat
nervously in his hand, and sat silent for a
moment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You see,” he began, paused, and began
again—“You see, if I were alone it
would be one thing. But I’m not—not at
all alone,” he added, evidently gaining
confidence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah!” exclaimed the old lawyer, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>sudden gleam of new intelligence shining
in his dull, weary old eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And how am I to get married, Mr.
Maskelyne?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The lady does not approve of your—poetic
aspirations?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not approve!” cried the young fellow,
eagerly; “she has made me promise
that I will give nothing up, that I will
refuse all Mr. Bevington has arranged
for me. You can’t tell how inspiring our
misery is. And our courage,—a young
Froissart must be our chronicler, sir. We
take our sorrows gladly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And may I ask——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Anything, anything,” interrupted the
young man, gayly. “I’m sent here to be
talked out of what they may call my folly.
You see I can’t be talked out of it. Don’t
that prove that it is no folly?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You seem,” said Maskelyne, dryly,
“to have settled it between you—you
and she.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>“Settled it! We did not need help
about that. It’s the unsettling. There
comes a time when friends are the worst
enemies. You know that, Mr. Maskelyne?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The old lawyer paused. “Indeed I
do,” he said at last, and the sneer stealing
over the outlines of his face slunk away before
the look of regret that came swiftly on.
Almost in embarrassment, with nervous
hand, he shuffled the papers on his table.</p>

<p class='c010'>Far back in the past, when his eyes
were not yet dimmed by the dust blown
from law-books, nor his ears deadened by
the stridulent clamor of litigation, before
his life had gone in attempts at</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Mastering the lawless science of our law,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>or he had lost himself in</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“That codeless myriad of precedent,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That wilderness of single instances;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>when he, too, dwelt in that other-world
of the young, forgotten by everyone but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>himself, but, although hardly ever remembered,
never forgotten by him—not one
grain of its golden sand, not one drop of
its honey-dew, not one tremor of its slightest
thrill—then even he had had his romance.
The freshness of the early spring
morning, the airy brightness of his young
visitor, himself no bad exponent of the day,
the awe-footed shadow which, with almost
unrecognized obtrusion, skirts the border
where the ripened grain fills the field of
life and nods to the ready sickle—was it
something of such kind, or was it the simple
story of which he had had such telling
intimation, that brought it all up in memory’s
half-tender glow? He, too, had once
been in love. He, too, had written verses
to his inamorata. He remembered it all
now, with a smile of mingled pity and
contempt. It needed no ransacking of the
brain now to quicken into full view his
own “It might have been”—to people
once more the mystic world whose first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>paradise is rich in the slight garniture of
glances and sighs and smiles and tears.
Lost in himself, the old man forgot his
visitor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are very young,” he said at last,
absently.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Twenty-three,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And she?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Eighteen.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was strange, but he, too, had been
twenty-three and she eighteen when the
end came in that glimmering, gleaming
past. He remembered, and how strange
the recollection seemed, taking her some
flowers and some slight silver gift—a poor,
inexpensive thing; she would let him give
no more because he, too, was in debt—on
her birthday. And now, with strange revulsion,
he hardened almost into his habitual
self, and grimly thought that it all
was youthful nonsense, and that all such
follies were very much alike. Had he
spoken, he would have been guilty of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>one of those faults often packed with error,
an apothegm—he would have said
that we only become original, even in our
folly, as age gives us character.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We could be so happy with so little,”
said the youthful lover.</p>

<p class='c010'>The old man started. These were his
own words many, many years ago; his
very words to his guardian when the final
appeal was made by old Bevington to
what he called his better judgment so
very, very long ago, in the dark, stately
house upon Second Avenue.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So very little,” repeated the young
man. “I have always said,” he continued,
as pleased with the conceit as if it
had never before glittered in the song of
finches of his feather, “that we should
have gold enough in her hair.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And is her hair golden?” asked
Maskelyne, and, startled by the sound of
such words dropped from the lips of the
distinguished counsel for many a soulless
corporation and many as soulless a man,
he added, hurriedly, “light.” And then
the old lawyer remembered that he too,
had a lock of hair that he had not sent
back when he returned her letters and her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>picture. How bright it was! What had
become of it? Where was it? In what
pigeon-hole, what secret drawer? He
could not for the moment remember. He
looked out of the window. How bright
the sunshine was! How empty the world!
It seemed to build up its vacancy around
him as a wall.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And she, of course, has no money?”
he said, turning again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“None.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He had been sure of it. He rose and
went to the window. The joyful attributes
of the morning were there, but they were
no longer joyful to him. The light fell in
the same broad flood, still promising the
glory of summer, the ripened harvest, but
there was no promise for him. The sparrows
preluded still the full-voiced singers
of the year, when leaves are heavy with
the dust and brooks run dry, but he heard
only a quick, petulant twitter. A sort of
dull despondency suddenly settled upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>him. He forgot his visitor, and even time
and place. Amid the glimmering lights
and shaking shadows of the past he sought
a vision, as at twilight one seeks in some
deserted corridor a statue which would
seem to have so taken into its grain the
last rays of the already sunken sun that
the marble glows in the gathering darkness
with a radiance not its own.</p>

<p class='c010'>The young man grew impatient as the
revery was prolonged. He stirred uneasily.
The old lawyer turned and looked
curiously at him. Of course, of course!
Was a man to be changed, the bone of
what he was to have its marrow drawn,
the fibre of every muscle to be untwisted,
by this nonsense of a boy? Of course
old Bevington was right—and for the moment
he did not remember that Bevington
was dead—in sending the young fool to
such a cool old hand as himself. But if
Bevington had known what a turbulence
of disappointment, discontent, and revolt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>had risen, and poured in strength-gathering
torrent, even at that instant, through
his heart, would he not have kept his
young charge away? He would talk to
him—certainly he would—pave his way
for him, perhaps, as with flagstones of
wisdom. Perhaps—and then he thought
with grim satisfaction of what Bevington
might think should he learn that he recognized
that there were other paths than
those edged by a curbstone.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>“You have been sent to me,” he said,
very seriously, coming from the window
and leaning with both hands on the table,
“for advice and admonition. I will give
my lesson in sternest characters. I will
teach by example, but I may not teach
what you were sent here to learn. When
I was young as you—do not start, I was
young once,” and he spoke with infinite
sadness, “I loved as you love, and, as
with you, love was returned. They who
called themselves my friends strove, with
what they called reason, to tear me from
what they called my folly. My folly! It
was the wisdom that it takes all that is
blent into humanity, at supremest moments,
to attain; their reason, the fatuous
folly only enough to give habitual stir
to an earth-beclotted brain! I yielded,
as you have not yielded. I killed out
even the natural impulses of my nature.
Gradually almost new instincts came, desire
for delight sank into appetite for gain,
hope for the joy of higher existence was
lost in the ambition for mere advancement.
I wrought out in myself that fearful
piece of handiwork whose every effort
is but to grasp the worthless handful man
can only wrest from the mere world. I
lost, and I have not won. I was a man
and I am only a lawyer, and to him you
have been sent for advice. I can find no
precedent better, no authority more
weighty for your guidance than my own
life. Such strength as enabled me to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>work such a change will also enable you
to make yourself a new being, to accomplish
self-overthrow, to bring you to what I
am—a man rich, successful, courted, revered—most
miserable. He who has so
won, so lost, stands alone or he would not
so win. Choose rather the close companionship
of worldly defeat, if it must be, and
I say to you in the rapture of your youth,
clay plastic to the moment’s touch, hold
to yourself, and believe that no fame, no
power, no wealth, can compensate for a
contentious life, an empty heart, a desolate
old age. If I were you——”</p>

<p class='c010'>He did not finish. Slowly the young
stranger rose to his full height, every lineament
of his face clear in cold light. His
whole aspect was one of steadfast command.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Stop!” he cried, in a stern tone. “I
am yourself. No ghost walks save that
which is what a man might have been.
We throng the world. Beside everyone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>through life moves the image of a past
potentiality, the thing he could have become
had he held along another course.
I am what you were, the promise of what
you might have been. For forty years I
have walked by your side. I have touched
you and you have shuddered, I have
chilled you and you have shrunk from me.
Your nature has so grown athwart, all impulse
has been so long gone, all that softens
or ennobles so thrown off that, in almost
final self-assertion, what you really
were or might have been stands by your
side and bids you measure stature with
itself. Your life has entered upon its wintry
days, but sunlight is sunshine even in
December and in youth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The old lawyer, almost shuddering,
stepped back with repelling gesture. He
passed his hand quickly across his eyes,
and then, as if his heart had beat recall,
summoning back every retreating force in
quick rally, compelled but not unwilling,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>he turned in combative instinct to meet
the stranger face to face, nature to nature,
turned—and found himself alone.</p>

<p class='c010'>Once more the clerk opened the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Eleven o’clock, sir,” he said, “and
you know the General Term this morning——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You saw the gentleman who just went
out?” asked the lawyer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I, sir,” answered the man; “I saw no
one go out.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No one?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No one.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You certainly brought me a card and
showed a young gentleman in a few minutes
ago?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I, sir!” repeated the clerk. “I
brought in a card and showed a young
gentleman in! Aren’t you well this morning,
sir?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That will do,” said Maskelyne, sternly.</p>

<p class='c010'>As soon as he was again alone he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>stepped to the table. The card and the
letter were gone. And still he knew he
had not been dreaming. A man swung
high in the air was busy painting a sign
upon a building not far away, and he was
conscious that all through the strange interview
he had watched him at work. He
had seen him finish one letter and then
another, and now if he found him adding
the final consonant he would be assured
that he could not have been asleep. He
looked up and found that he was right.
The man had just made the heavy shaded
side and was busy putting the little finishing
line at the bottom of the letter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two men—one of rotund middle age,
the other younger but yet not young—came
down the steps of the Union Club
one day a few weeks later. They met
an old man rounding the corner of the
Avenue.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>“See what you would come to if you
had your own way,” said the elder of the
two. “There’s old Maskelyne. He’s
got everything you’re making yourself
wretched to get. Do you want to be like
him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” said the other. “Then you
haven’t heard?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Heard what?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s a changed man, all within a
month.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Has his brain or his heart softened?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“As you look at life,” said the younger.
“He has sent for that clever, improvident,
gracefully graceless good-fellow of a good-for-nothing,
his nephew, him and his
pretty-handed, big-eyed wife—he hadn’t
seen either of them since they ran away
and were married—sent for them and put
them in his great, old house and—didn’t
you hear Maceration growling about the
luck some people have just before we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>left? He says the nephew will have all
the old man’s property.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s the world coming to?” said
the senior, “or what is coming to the
world?”</p>

<h3 class='c015'>I</h3>

<p class='c016'>The Archibald house, on West Forty-—
Street, was of the character described
as a “modernized front.” A handsome
arch in rough stone surmounted the front-door,
which was done in polished oak and
plate-glass. The stoop was on a level
with the sidewalk; a richly carved bow-window
jutted out from the second story.
“No. 41,” in old iron open work, formed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>a pretty grating above the door. There
was, in fact, nothing which would lead an
ordinary person to conceive of the house
as given over to boarders, except, possibly,
the sign,</p>

<div class='border'>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>TO LET, FURNISHED.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c014'>which was posted conspicuously below
the first-story window, and at an angle
which enabled him that ran to read.</p>

<p class='c010'>Old Mr. Archibald’s death, the autumn
before, had left his widow rather poorer
than she anticipated. He was a great
collector of pretty things. His taste was
exquisite, and he had gratified it by filling
his house with a variety of <i>bric-à-brac</i>,
pictures, statuary, and old furniture,
which made it a centre of attraction
to many of the old gentleman’s artistic
friends. Mrs. Archibald, loath to dispose
of her husband’s art collections, determined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>to let the house, as it stood, “at
an exorbitant figure, to a very rich tenant
without children.” Under these terms,
on her departure for Europe, her agent
was entrusted with the house, and her
son Jerome, when he saw her off on the
steamer, received a parting injunction,
“Be sure and see that they have no
children.” Jerome Archibald saw his
mother and sisters depart—in no very enviable
frame of mind; but he was a good
son, and he resolved to forego Newport,
if it would tend to dispose of the house as
his mother wished, and add to her diminished
income.</p>

<p class='c010'>His mother and sisters sailed in May.
It was now July, and very warm and disagreeable.
As the “heated term” set
in, he began to think it too bad, you
know, of mamma and the girls to remain
abroad for three whole years. It was
positively absurd. What was he to do?
After the house was let—where was he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>to go? By Jove, he felt deuced lonely,
don’t you know! It was especially trying
for a sensitive man to go in and out of a
house with a great placard on it, “To
Let, Furnished,” but it was a deal more
trying to have people come and want
board. Yes, actually, two ladies came
one morning and wanted to know if they
could see the landlord. It was positively
ridiculous! His agent was a clevah fellow,
but even he gave up hope of letting
the house until fall. Hadn’t he better
run down to Newport? He got a letter
from Dick Trellis that morning, and they
really didn’t see how they were going to
get on without him in the polo matches.
It put him in a fuming fury. He had
never stayed late in the city in summer
before. How infernally hot it was—and
nahsty—don’t you know! His collars
were in a perpetual state of wilt—they
never wilted at Newport. Then everybody
was not only out of town, having a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>good time somewhere, but they had a provoking
way now of ostentatiously boarding
up their front-doors—yes—and their
windows, too—which made it doubly disagreeable
for those who had to remain.
It was bad enough to see the blinds
drawn down, but boxing up their stonework
and planking up their front-doors
caused Mr. Jerome Archibald unutterable
pangs. Then they thought it was
a boarding-house!</p>

<p class='c010'><i>They</i> were coming again in the afternoon,
at four. There were two of them—ladies.
In his rather depressing and
solitary occupation of living alone in his
house, with one solemn apoplectic cook
and one chalk-faced maid, in order to exhibit
it to that endless raft of females with
“permits,” who universally condemned
or “damned with faint praise” his father’s
exquisite taste in rugs and furniture,
Mr. Jerome Archibald had to-day
admitted to himself a distinct pleasure in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>showing “Miss Perkins” and her niece
(whose name did not happen at the time
to be mentioned) over the house, and
pointing out in his quiet way its excellences.</p>

<p class='c010'>They saw the sign, they said, and so
made bold to enter. Evidently Miss Perkins
was a prim, thin, tall, spectacled,
New England old maid. She had the
delicate air and manner of a lady. A lady
faded, perhaps, and unused to a larger
social area than that surrounding her native
village green. She had also the timid
manner of hesitancy of New England
spinsters—hesitancy concerning everything
except questions of casuistry and
religion—and seemed, in what she did, to
be spurred on from behind by the niece,
who was, on the whole, as Mr. Jerome
Archibald told a friend at the club later,
“quite extraordinary.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In the first place, as he said, the niece
was undeniably beautiful.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>“She wore rawther an odd street
dress,” he said, “made up in the country
somewhere, by a seamstress who gathered
her crude notions of the prevailing fashions
from some prevaricating ladies’ journal,
and her hat was something positively
ridiculous—but her <i>face</i>!” The fastidious
Mr. Jerome Archibald at once conceded
to it a certain patrician quality of
elegance. It denoted pure blood and
pure breeding, somewhere up among Vermont
hills or Maine forests. A long line
of “intelligent ancestors,” perhaps. It
was fine, and—beautiful. The forehead
high, nose straight, the large eyes gray,
the mouth and chin sweet, and yet quite
determined. When he showed them a
large room at the rear, on the second
story, facing the north, the niece had observed,
with a lofty air—mind, the room
was literally crammed with the most costly
<i>bric-à-brac</i>—“I think this will suit me very
well, aunt dear, on account of the light.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>He noticed in her unfashionable dress a
certain artistic sense of freedom, a <i>soupçon</i>
of colored ribbon here and there, and he
concluded that she was all the more interesting,
as an artist, in that she so quietly
accepted the elegancies around her. She
gave an unconscious sigh over a small
glass-covered “Woodland Scene,” by
Duprez. Mr. Jerome Archibald noticed
it, and inwardly smiled, delighted.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perhaps the niece captivated him the
more by her silent appreciation of some
things he himself admired exceedingly.
It was odd that she seemed always to
choose <i>his</i> favorites. There was nothing
said as to the rent, the size of the house,
the lot, the plumbing. He spent an hour
showing his etchings alone, and in the
afternoon, at four, they were coming
again, “to decide.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>II.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Of course Mr. Jerome Archibald must
have been an extremely susceptible young
man to have fallen in love at first sight
with a strange young woman, who had
come to look at his house with a view to
renting. But he was—“rawther down
and depressed.” The usual summer malaria
had set in. The usual excavations
in the streets were going on—they were
digging with “really extraordinary energy”
that summer—the pavements were
up on all the Fortieth streets. Fifth
Avenue presented the appearance of a
huge empty canal. It was something
more, this presidential year, than the perennial
laying down and taking up of pipes.
“He was really ripe for <i><span lang="fr">une grande affaire
du cœur</span></i>,” said one of his club friends, he
was getting so lonesome. He <i>did</i> fall
quite entirely in love, precipitately, unquestionably,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>in spite of the fact that they
took the house for a boarding-place!
They asked to hire but one room only.</p>

<p class='c010'>When they arrived, at 4 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, they sat
a few moments in the reception-room,
while the chalk-faced, alert maid announced
them to Archibald in the room
above. Miss Perkins folded her faded,
gloved hands in her lap and sat up on the
sofa stiffly. They had looked at ever so
many houses, and they had come back to
No. 41 with instinctive preference.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think one room would be so
very expensive,” said Miss Perkins.
“He could put up two beds easily in
that north room, and the room we saw
on Thirty-fourth Street was only twelve
dollars—what do you think, Elvira?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think twelve dollars is altogether
too high,” said the niece, looking up
from a delicate little Elzevir she was
holding. “I think he wants to let the
rooms very much; none of them seem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>to be taken. Remember it is midsummer,
aunt dear.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a little pause.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course he will prefer having <i>nice</i>
people. It will be a great help to your
art, Elvira—you can study at great advantage.
There are so many pictures
for you to copy. I think your father
would say it was a ‘lucky find.’ If you
will persist in your art, why, I think
we are very fortunate.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are always ready to sneer at
my art, Aunt Perkins.” And she gave a
peculiar laugh.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is something that has come up
since my day,” she replied, glancing
about over the pictures and the rare
editions on the table. “I was brought
up to plain living. But I guess if we
can get it all for twelve dollars we
ought to be satisfied. It’s a pleasant
change to see the city. It’s pleasant
to see these ornaments. Yes, I don’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>blame art so much as your father does,
Elvira, and I don’t believe <i>he</i> would
blame it if he knew we could have so
much of it for twelve dollars.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Father secretly admires it as much
as I do,” said the niece; “only he likes
to talk.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Just then Mr. Jerome Archibald entered.
He was faultlessly dressed in
half-mourning for his father. Indeed,
he had dressed himself with exceeding
care, being desirous, he frankly admitted
to himself, of making an impression.
He bowed graciously, and took Elvira’s
extended gloved hand, which, as she
offered it, he held a moment. “Have
you decided?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>They had explained, when they left in
the morning, that they should want only
one room, and he tacitly inferred that
they would require board. He received
a dreadful shock, but made up his mind
that the charming niece would prove the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>more charming on closer acquaintance,
and he deliberately decided to keep both
the gentle New Englanders under his
roof for a time, if he could! The more
he thought of the plan, the more interesting
the situation became to him. He
fairly dreaded, at last, lest they should
find their way into a remote boarding-house
in some cheap quarter of the city,
where it would be quite impossible for
him to follow them. He gravely announced
to the astonished maid that
he had determined to let out the rooms
to the ladies, who, he pretended for
her benefit, were old acquaintances.
When they were announced he was
scarcely able to conceal his pleasure.
Mr. Jerome Archibald had fallen in
love.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We have decided to take one room,”
said Elvira, “if we can agree upon the
price; and we wish to know the price of
board—”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>“We shan’t want much to eat,” put in
Miss Perkins, with a nervous twitch.</p>

<p class='c010'>Archibald admirably concealed a smile.
His long mustache aided him a good
deal in doing this. He was still standing,
and he put his hand to his lips: “I
think we shall agree very easily upon
the price,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Perkins again twitched a little.
“We thought twelve dollars—room and
board——” she said, leaving the sentence
half finished, while Elvira looked up at
him, expectantly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dear ladies, I should not think
of charging more than ten. You are
strangers in the city, and I would not
impose upon you for the world. It happens
that this is the dull season——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So we thought,” said Miss Perkins,
“and board and lodging ought to come
a little cheaper.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Precisely. The maid will show you
your sleeping-room—and, of course, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>entire house is at your service. I hope
you will find everything to your comfort.
I am very anxious to please.” He
laughed a little.</p>

<p class='c010'>Elvira gave him a grateful, but at the
same time a rather patronizing, glance.
He felt at once that in carrying out his
little <i>ruse</i> he had placed himself deliberately
upon a questionable footing with
the beautiful girl. He hoped, however,
to redeem himself by impressing her
with his knowledge of the pursuit which,
he accurately judged, had brought the
ladies to the city. Archibald had at one
time done a little painting himself. He
had dreamed dreams, as a young man,
which indolence and the stern business
atmosphere of the city had choked off
prematurely. As he looked down upon
the girl’s sweet gray eyes a vision of
this youthful period came back to him.
Twenty-two and thirty-two have this in
common, that the latter age is not too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>far away to quite despise the younger
enthusiasm. Archibald at thirty-two
still believed in himself, don’t you know.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>III.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Several days passed, during which
the ladies settled themselves very readily
in their new surroundings. They were
very methodical, preferring to rise at
an hour which, to Archibald, was something
savoring of barbarism. He studied
their habits, with a view to conforming to
them as far as possible, but found that
he could not bring himself to give up his
nine-o’clock breakfasts, and so went to
his club, leaving orders that the ladies
should be accommodated at the earliest
hour they might choose. He found that
they had discovered Central Park, and
came to make it a habit to stroll with
them of a morning upon the Mall, and
around the stagnant lakes. Central Park
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>was a novelty to him, except as seen
from horseback, or a four-in-hand, and
it really seemed very beautiful those summer
mornings—he was really surprised,
don’t you know! He wondered that
nice people did not use the Park more—as
they did Hyde Park in London.
As the days went on he filled his house
with flowers, turned the second floor
into an immense studio for Elvira, sat
about and watched her, criticised, encouraged
her. He forgot Newport, forgot
his polo. He had strangely ceased to
be bored. He was happy in New York
in midsummer! Dick Trellis told his
polo friends at Newport that Archibald
was probably undergoing private treatment
for softening of the brain, which
theory, in fact, they deemed sufficiently
complimentary.</p>

<p class='c010'>As for his mother and sisters in Europe—why,
pray, should he inform them of
his little joke?</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>Elvira worked away at her easel when
the light was best—during the afternoon.
In the evening, after dinner, the
ladies became socially inclined. It was
then that they allowed Archibald to
smoke in the “studio” and talk Art with
Elvira. Indeed he found it very difficult
to talk anything else with the shy
New England primrose.</p>

<p class='c010'>About Art—with a big A—she was
rapturous. There seemed to be in her
soul a strange hunger for everything
ornate and richly beautiful. Archibald
devoted himself to studying her. He
became strangely interested in East
Village, Vt., where, he gathered, the
Hon. Ephraim B. Price, her father, was
a very distinguished Republican lawyer
and politician. He drew Aunt Perkins
out concerning her Congregational
church, her minister, her fear of the
Catholics, her fondness for cats, her secret
disbelief in Art. Once in a while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>they read him a letter from the Hon.
Ephraim, in which he could see reflected
their own liking for <i>him</i>. He found that
he was spoken of as “Landlord Archibald.”
The Hon. Ephraim was a shrewd
old fellow, however, and his counsels and
advice were generally of the “trust-not-too-much-to-appearances”
order. One
evening Miss Perkins complained of a
headache, and Archibald found himself
alone for an hour with Elvira. She
sat beneath the rich brazen lamp, with
its pretty crimson shade, absorbing
some of the red glow in her lovely
face. They had been two weeks in the
city, and out of delicate feeling had
deposited two ten-dollar bills upon the
mantelpiece in the library, where Archibald
would see them. He had roared
with laughter over them and intended
having them framed, but ultimately he
found a different use for their amusing
board-money.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>He made some little allusion to the
time they had been with him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Two very short weeks,” said Elvira,
“and you have been so very unusually
kind, Mr. Archibald. You have done so
much for us. We have noticed it. Is
it usual for landlords to—to do so much,
in the city?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It depends,” he said, gravely. “Landlords
do more for people who are congenial—you
are congenial——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh!” A slight pause.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are more than congenial, <i>really</i>,”
said Archibald. “For you take an interest,
Miss Price. I have secretly espied
both you and your aunt dusting——”</p>

<p class='c010'>Elvira bit her lip. “We <i>have</i> dusted,”
she admitted, reddening a little, “but it
is merely out of force of habit.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Really,” said Archibald, “I rawther
like you the better for it, don’t you
know!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m afraid,” said Elvira, her face
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>lighting up with conscious pleasure, “that
you have made up your mind as a landlord
to like us, whatever we do. I’m
afraid you would not like it at all if you
knew everything that aunt has done.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell me—I will keep it a profound secret,
I assure you,” he laughed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She has actually dared to invade your
kitchen!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Has she?” said Archibald, dubiously;
“really!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, and she declares that your cook
wastes enough every day to keep four
families!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Really!” said Archibald; “I’ll have
to look into it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You won’t save much out of what we
pay,” said Elvira, “and we don’t want to
stay if it doesn’t pay you; but——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Archibald, we are poor.” She
looked down.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m very sorry, I’m sure—I—” he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>really did feel a compassion which found
its way into his voice, and made it tremble
a little.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Aunt says you <i>can’t</i> be making any
money. Now, we don’t think it is right
to stay another day and be <i>burdens</i>, do
you see?”</p>

<p class='c010'>A solemn pause.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Isn’t that what they are talking about
so much now in the novels?” he asked,
at length.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The terrible New England conscience?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Right is right and wrong is wrong,
Mr. Archibald, disguise it how we may,”
and Elvira compressed her pretty lips
firmly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Archibald puffed on his cigar, lazily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wasn’t sure,” he said, as if a doubt
had crept into his mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>She glanced at him impatiently.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can’t you <i>see</i> how wrong it would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>for us to stay here and enjoy all we have
in your beautiful house, knowing that we
were swindling you?” She stamped her
foot. “Mercy!” she added, half to herself,
“what <i>can</i> you be made of?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He hastened to a display of rugged conscience,
which relieved her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, of course, I see how wicked it
would be if you <i>did</i> swindle; but I’m
making money! Really—I haven’t spent
the twenty dollars board-money yet. Oh,
pray rest assured—I shan’t lose. I will
tell you when I run behind.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A great sense of relief seemed to come
over the girl.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But it is all we can pay. I told father
I would not ask for more. Father said he
knew it would take more, but I said I
would give up Art first.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I say!” he protested.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And to-morrow I am going to begin
taking lessons, but I <i>will</i> not call on father
for another cent. He shan’t be able
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>to throw it in my face that it turned out
as he said, and that I was wrong. When
he and I dispute it always does turn out
as he says—this time it <i>shan’t</i>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Archibald laughed a little. The poor
fool, don’t you know, was so captivated
that every word, every action of the girl
was music to him. The two weeks of observation
had told on her dress. To-night
she wore a white muslin, elaborated with
pretty ribbons. She no longer seemed
especially rustic to him. He noticed that
she was doing her hair now in the prevailing
style. “By Jove!” he said to himself,
“I’ll see that she comes out at the
Patriarchs’ next winter!”</p>

<p class='c010'>This was his highest earthly happiness
for a <i>débutante</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am going to make money,” she
went on; “I’m going to paint vases,
plates, odds and ends, pot-boilers, you
know, and so father shan’t know what it
costs.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>
<img src='images/i_139.jpg' alt='[Woman]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>“Oh, by the way, if you do,” he pretended,
lazily blowing out a ring of
smoke, “I happen to know a fellow—an
old friend of mine—who gives very fair
prices for those sort of things. Now, I
am sure he will take any gimcrack you
may do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Somehow the word gimcrack displeased
her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My Art work has always been thought
very pretty in East Village,” she said.
“It would never <i>sell</i>, but it was thought
pretty. I used to long to help father—and
our family is so large, you know, four
little brothers and two sisters younger
than I am—and now, if I only <i>could</i> get
on, and help father! Oh, Mr. Archibald,
you don’t know how <i>little</i> law there is to
go round in East Village!” She heaved
a deep sigh.</p>

<p class='c010'>He tried to appear sympathetic.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know a fellow who gets a thousand
dollars for a portrait, and he has only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>just commenced. You can’t help but succeed,
Miss Price, really!”</p>

<p class='c010'>She gave him a grateful glance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, if I <i>could</i>!” she said, anxiously.
“I taught school one winter, but the pay
was so small. And I’ve tried—you will
laugh, Mr. Archibald, at my telling you
these things—but I’ve tried story writing.
I was <i>so</i> hopeful about it, and it took as
many as ten rejections before I became
convinced; and now, if my Art fails
me——”</p>

<p class='c010'>She gave a little fluttering sigh.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think you have talent.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps it is only enthusiasm——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That amounts to the same thing. It
will keep you up to your work. They
used to tell me I had talent, but I had no
enthusiasm, so I dropped it. I wish to
encourage you,” he added; “I hope you
will go on. It takes a lot of work, but
you have just the right temperament.
You <i>will</i> work. You <i>will</i> get on, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>when you become celebrated, Miss Price,
you won’t forget your old friends?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He realized that it was a rather bold
step forward, and he trembled for her
reply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall always recommend your
house,” she said, a little stiffly, making
him feel more than ever her aristocratic
superiority to landlords, “and I shall always
remember your kindness. We went
to at least six boarding-houses until we
saw your sign—we saw the landladies.
Really, Mr. Archibald, you have no idea
how vulgar and unartistic <i>most</i> of the
houses were. There was always a disagreeable
odor, as if somebody was frying
something. If I <i>do</i> succeed, as I wish,
and make friends, and get to be known,
and all, you may be certain that I shan’t
forget you. I may organize an Art class,
and take the whole house myself!”</p>

<p class='c010'>He went no further. It was enough to
him, as he sat opposite her in his evening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>dress, his rich opal, set with diamonds,
flashing on his white shirt-front, his lawn
tie, low shoes, white waistcoat—everything
in the latest and most expensive
style—it was enough for Mr. Jerome
Archibald to sit there and smoke his delicate
Havana, and reflect that he at least
had her promise to do what she could to
recommend his boarding-house!</p>

<p class='c010'>The next day, at dinner, he again suggested,
in an offhand way, that Miss
Price should turn her attention to portrait-painting.
Miss Perkins seriously
objected at once.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your father would never give his
consent,” she said. “There was old Mr.
Raymond, who lived on the Poor Farm,
because he found portrait-painting didn’t
pay.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Raymond painted dreadful, hideous
caricatures,” said Elvira. “He
painted my mother’s portrait, and father
is always throwing him in my face. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>I don’t know. I have no one to begin
on except aunt, and I have tried and
tried, and I can’t get anything but the
expression of her spectacles.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Even Aunt Perkins laughed at this a
little.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Begin on me,” ventured Archibald.
“Call it the ‘Portrait of an Ideal Landlord.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a little pause. The ladies
rose without replying, and Archibald followed
them into the drawing-room, feeling
indefinitely that he had been too forward.
As he lit his cigar and sat near an
open window, feeling the cool southern
breeze, he reflected that it was not improbable
that in East Village the only
landlord known to them was the keeper
of a common tavern. It amused him to
think of their primitive, quaint ignorance
of city ways. He pictured the small life
of East Village, Vt., the narrow social
horizon, the strange interest in politics,
the religious intolerance, the “strong”
views on the temperance question which
obtained there, and which leaked out
from Miss Perkins as the days went on
into August. The easy sense of accommodation
to their new surroundings also
amused him.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>
<img src='images/i_145.jpg' alt='[Man]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>Archibald returned to the portrait. “I’d
rawther like to have one for the dining-room,”
he said; “I think it would interest
some of my boarders when they come
back next winter. I could give you no
end of sittings, Miss Price——”</p>

<p class='c010'>Elvira exhibited some hesitancy:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I might try,” she said. “But
I’m not at all good at hair——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shave off my mustache if you like,”
said the infatuated Archibald, with a grimace.</p>

<p class='c010'>The ladies changed the subject decorously.
It was plain that Archibald’s little
advances toward an intimacy, to be derived
from portrait-painting, were being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>met in rather an unencouraging spirit,
don’t you know! The next day he invited
them, as an agreeable diversion, to
visit Coney Island; but Elvira made an
excuse that she had no time for “pleasuring.”
They seemed, indeed, to have few
pleasures. The morning walk in Central
Park was given up; Miss Perkins spent
the greater part of the time when Elvira
was at the Art School in riding to and
fro, apparently, upon street-cars. One day
she came home very late to dinner, saying
that she had discovered the “Belt
Line.” While waiting her return for dinner,
Archibald had an agreeable <i>tête-à-tête</i>
with Elvira.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>IV.</h3>

<p class='c016'>He was growing more and more in love
with this self-contained, charming, young
New Englander. It had come to a time
when he felt that he must speak. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>had been at No. 41 now these four weeks,
aunt and niece, and yet they had managed
to preserve their distance. He was
no nearer than the day they arrived.</p>

<p class='c010'>He reflected that the pleasant little daily
comedy which had amused him so entirely
would have to be given up the instant
he made known to her his state of feeling.
But at the same time he felt he
could act out the equivocation no longer.
He must, as a gentleman, make a clean
breast of his deception. Archibald had
seen a great deal of women, and he believed
that he understood them pretty
well. He believed he understood Miss
Price well enough to reckon upon the
flattery of her sudden fascination that first
day, for him, as the cause of his deceit.
He planned to boldly tell her this, one
day, while they were waiting for Miss Perkins
to revolve around the “Belt Line.”
But Elvira turned the conversation against
his will. She seemed to have remarkable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>intuitions, this strange creature! Perhaps
she had an intuition then. At any
rate, she announced their determination
to return to East Village the following
Saturday.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Father writes that his ague is no better—that
I must come home,” she said.
“There are, besides, the preserves——”</p>

<p class='c010'>Archibald expressed no surprise. “If
you go,” he said, “I think I’ll take a run
up there also. I have the greatest curiosity
about East Village.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is nothing—it is dreadfully—I
wouldn’t have you visit East Village for
all the world!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because—” she replied, sedately.</p>

<p class='c010'>Recognizing this as a sufficient reply,
Archibald took a seat on the sofa near her.
She was in one of her pretty, soft, white
muslins, tied, this evening, with ribbons of
the very latest shade of fashionable apple-green.
He had noticed the steady growth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>of fashion in the girl’s appearance, but he
was not quite prepared for the dozen silver
bangles, which jingled as she raised
her hand to her hair. She had a pretty
arm and hand, and were it not for the
bangles, which somehow altered the current
of his thought, he had nerved himself
up to the point of taking, or trying to
take, her hand in his, and telling her in a
manly way his story. The bangles, however,
don’t you know, diverted him. He
could not be serious. He laughed. It
was as if he had happened upon a wood
nymph in seven-button kid gloves! She
misinterpreted his laughter, believing that
he intended to ridicule the pastoral delights
of East Village.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m not ashamed of Vermont,” she
said, drawing away a little. “I can’t
bear to have it laughed at. You would
laugh at East Village, Mr. Archibald—you
laugh at everything. You are not
sincere. You have too much of the city
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>in you—too much of its glitter and—”
She caught his eyes directed laughingly
upon her bangles, and blushed guiltily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Time works its changes, don’t you
know,” he said. “Even you, Miss Elvira,
are a <i>little</i> affected.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hate myself for it,” she said; “I <i>do</i>
find myself growing to like things I never
cared for before. I think of what I have
on from morning to night,” she confessed,
guiltily, with an imploring glance at her
landlord.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can the dead dulness of midsummer
in the city have wrought so wondrous a
change?” he laughed. “How very gay,
really, you will be next winter.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Seriously,” said Elvira, “I look forward
to a visit to East Village as a complete
change and rest. When I think of
the white, dead walls of our meetinghouse,
I am glad; when I think of the
lack of color in everybody up there, it
makes me glad; when I think of the plainness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>of everything, the simpleness, the
<i>truth</i> of everything, I’m glad to go back.
But don’t you—don’t come up to Vermont,
Mr. Archibald. Really, please,
don’t.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Again Archibald felt impelled to seize
her white, pretty hand, and tell his story.
He had never come to so intimate a point
before. What chance had he ever to
come so near again? All that his mother
and sisters could write would have no effect
upon him now. All that his friends
at the club would say, all that his Aunt
Newbold would say—his Aunt Newbold
was the formidable dragon of his family—nothing,
he felt sure, would alter his
mind. He had deliberated a month, he
would deliberate no more. Besides, she
was going away; perhaps if he did <i>not</i>
speak his opportunity would never again
occur. He paled a little as he was about
to open his lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bother!</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>The chalk-faced maid entered with a
card on a silver tray.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>V.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Jerome Archibald had very few
hatreds; people whom he disliked he
carefully avoided. Being fastidious to an
extreme, he had few friends, but he likewise
had no enemies. He had, however,
a certain cousin who lived in Boston, who
had in some way early offended him, and
for whom he continued to have a most inexplicable
dislike. Hunnewell Hollis was
a Harvard man, who had been a great
swell at college, and who was considered
“clevah.” He was a year or two older
than Archibald, and he usually presumed
a little upon his age and upon his superior
education. It was Hunnewell Hollis’s
card which was brought up on the
silver tray.</p>

<p class='c010'>Archibald impatiently rose and went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>down to the reception-room. There he
found Hollis walking up and down the
room, apparently in some excitement.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Jerry, this won’t do, old man!—heard
ladies’ voices upstairs! ’Twon’t do!
Lucky I ran down with the yacht. Now
I’m going to carry you off with me. By
the way, Somers and Billy Nahant and
Jack Chadwick are here, and I took the
liberty to invite them here overnight—knew
you were alone—knew you would
be glad to put them up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“By Jove, you do me great honor!
Unfortunately I haven’t room for you—I’ve
only just let the house—taken—by
Jove! I must take in the sign.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Archibald’s face betrayed no sign of his
justifiable prevarication.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, then, as it is dinner-time I’ll
stay to dinner with you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sorry, very sorry. But the ladies who
have taken the house would think it very
odd——”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>“Well, how in the devil are <i>you</i> dining
with them, Jerry?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They asked me, in order to discuss
the terms. A few details before signing
the lease, don’t you know!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, it puts me in a rather awkward
position; I’ve left the fellows your address;
they’ll be here shortly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why don’t you head ’em off?” suggested
Archibald, coolly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Hunnewell Hollis gave his cousin
a glance of anger. “The whole thing is
rather fishy,” he said, suspiciously. “I
trust, Jerry, for the honor of the family——”</p>

<p class='c010'>Archibald never quite detested his cousin
so much before.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There are a great many adventuresses
about; they are on the lookout for
rich young men like you, Jerry,” and
Hunnewell Hollis, giving his cousin a
rather gravely serious nod, took up his
hat and cane and departed.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Archibald went directly upstairs. He
heard a rustle of a dress against the furniture.
Had Elvira been listening? He
hoped not.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>VI.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Adventuress! How that odious word
rang in his ears as he entered the room
where the sweet primrose face was still
in its corner of the sofa. He swore he
would never write to, nor speak to, Hunnewell
Hollis again. He had done with
him forever. Yet, had he heard the rustle
of her dress? It gave him a slightly disagreeable
sensation to think that it were
possible. Elvira Price apparently had
not moved from her seat. She was in the
same pretty attitude in which he had left
her, leaning back, easily, against the corner
of the sofa, her hands crossed in her
lap. As he entered it seemed to him that
she was studying his face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was so anxious about aunt,” she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>said. “I went out to the stairs thinking
I heard her come in. Do you know, it
isn’t the Belt Line only; she goes to a
mission—a boy’s mission. She has taken
the greatest interest in it; all the teachers
have gone away for the summer. It is in
an out-of-the-way part of the city, and it
worries me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Archibald hesitated a moment, then he
said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you hear the row with my cousin?
He was very impertinent; but all
Bostonians are impertinent.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The name Bostonian seemed to give
her a slight sensation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have been in Boston?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“N—yes, and I, too, found Bostonians
impertinent.” She gave him an appealing
glance; then she added, after a
pause, “I find New York quite different.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Perkins came in shortly after,
much fatigued, and Archibald after dinner
went over to the club, where he fell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>in with Hunnewell Hollis again, in spite
of the fact that he did his best to avoid
him. Hunnewell had found his yachting
friends, and they had had a very good
dinner. They were all very talkative—Somers,
Billy Nahant, and Jack Chadwick.
They were in flannel suits and
yachting caps, and each was bronzed and
sunburned to a fine copper hue.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is the name of the people who
have taken your house?” asked Hunnewell,
bluntly, after he had introduced
Archibald to his friends.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Perkins and her niece, Miss
Elvira Price,” replied Archibald, coldly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Instantly Billy Nahant pricked up his
ears. “Why,” he said, “isn’t she an
actress? Didn’t she play in Boston last
winter?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who?” asked Archibald.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, Elvira Price. She made quite
a hit, I believe—her <i>début</i> too—at the
Boston Theatre. She played to crowded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>houses exactly two weeks; at the end
of that time, to everyone’s surprise, she
went home to Vermont, whence she came,
and she calmly gave up the stage forever!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Archibald’s face was a study.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you know you were letting your
mother’s house to actresses?” asked Hollis,
with a sneer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Price is probably a different person
from the one to whom Mr. Nahant
has reference,” said Archibald, coldly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I remember the girl,” said Jack Chadwick.
“She was very young and beautiful,
and fitted her part admirably. She
made an excellent <i>ingénue</i>. She held
herself well—not at all gushing, don’t you
know—but poetic, <i>spirituelle</i>. She played
in ‘A Scrap of Paper’—some picked-up
company with her. She carried the play
very well. I have often wondered what
became of her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So this is the creature who has rented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>your house, and whom you dined with to-night,”
sneered Hollis; “an <i>ingénue</i>,
indeed!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Price is a lady—not a ‘creature,’”
said Archibald, haughtily. “As
far as I have seen, she can only honor
our house by remaining under its roof.”
And Archibald bowed stiffly, and took
his leave in the midst of an embarrassed
silence.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>VII.</h3>

<p class='c016'>He preferred not to see Elvira again
before she took her departure for Vermont
the next day. Her aunt remained
in the city to look after her “mission
work.” Archibald presented her, as the
gift of a rich, unknown friend, fifty dollars—their
board-money—to send some of
her boys into the country. After Elvira’s
departure he became very despondent.
Elvira’s image was broken to him, and
while she had not become in his mind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>quite an adventuress, yet she had concealed
her former life from him. She had
deceived him.</p>

<p class='c010'>But as the days went by and he missed
her, he found that he must speak to Miss
Perkins about Elvira’s acting, or go
through a serious case of nervous prostration.
He said very bluntly to her, one
day, at dinner:</p>

<p class='c010'>“So I hear your niece is a great actress.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Perkins gave him a quick, sharp
glance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She <i>has</i> acted,” she replied. “But
Elvira Price had too much conscience to
act <i>long</i>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He gave a sigh of relief.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She acted in Boston, because she
was bound to try it. She wanted to try
everything—everything that would keep
her father out of the poor-house and educate
the family. But acting, Mr. Archibald,
is a dreadful business! As soon as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>Elvira saw into it a little she quit. The
air wasn’t pure enough, somehow, for her.
Elvira, she needs awful pure air!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Again Archibald felt a certain glow of
satisfaction steal over him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you know,” he said, after a suitable
pause, “I am more than half-inclined
to make her angry by running up to East
Village.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Perkins gave a little quinzied
laugh of satisfaction. She was beginning
to like Archibald very much.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It would startle Elvira; but she’d be
pleased,” ventured the thin old maid.
“She’d be pleased—in spite of everything!”</p>

<p class='c010'>A few days later Archibald, after half a
day’s journey, found himself in Vermont.
As the train drew near East Village the
mountains grew higher and the scenery
wilder. He could see the great August
moon roll itself above the high crest of
the mountains to the west. Though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>Archibald was far from superstitious, he
was pained to observe that he saw the
moon over his left shoulder.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was late when he stumbled from the
steps of the car upon the wooden platform
of the station at East Village. It
was dark, also, and to him, extraordinarily
cold. He groped his way, shivering,
past a blinding reflector, where half a
dozen men in cow-hide boots were examing
a list of invoices, to what he could
dimly outline as the village stage. No
one spoke to him, and he found that no
one seemed to care whether he, the sole
passenger, was carried. He had visions
of an unpleasant nature of being deposited
inside the coach in a shed or stable
to await the morning. He felt the stage
pitch and toss for twenty minutes like a
bark upon an angry sea. When all was
still again he found that the driver had
drawn up before a white-pillared old-fashioned
house, which stood a little back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>from the street. At the side of the gate
a small wooden building bore the sign,
which was illuminated by the stage lamp,</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><i>Ephraim B. Price, Attorney at Law.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Oh,” said Archibald, “this is Elvira’s
house, and the driver is delivering my
box of flowers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He leaned forward, hoping to catch
sight of the fair young girl when the front-door
opened to take in the box. But he
was disappointed. The impatient driver
had merely left it on the steps of the
high, white-pillared portico, after giving
the door-bell a vigorous pull.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then followed a further few minutes of
pitching and tossing, and the stage drew
up before the tavern-door. A row of a
dozen men, whose hats were drawn down
over their eyes, and whose feet fell instantaneously
from the rail to the floor as the
coach drew up, came forward, and one of
them betrayed a desire to grasp Archibald’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>in his own horny hand. “Guess
ye’ll stop overnight? Th’ain’t no other
place. ’Sprised to see a stranger to-night,
tew. Will you go in an’ sign—will you,
sir?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So this uncouth ruffian,” thought
Archibald, “is Elvira’s ideal landlord!
No wonder she distrusts me!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We’re local temp’rance,” said the
landlord. “An’ no licker’s being seen to
East Village for nigh six years. Not a
drop, sir, an’ it’s bustin’ my ho-tel higher’n
a kite. Yes, it is!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Archibald expressed commiseration.</p>

<p class='c010'>“As I tell’d Squar’ Price, ‘yeou high-toned,
’ristocratic temp’rance folk’ll hurt
East Village when ye close the hotel!’
Why, when a gent comes up here fr’ the
city, he wants to be able to call fer a
glass o’ gin or a glass o’ whiskey ’s often
’s he likes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Archibald thought he detected the faint
smell of liquor upon the landlord’s breath
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>as he talked, and it occurred to him that
his obtrusively free-and-easy-manner was
the result of a secret violation of the prohibitory
local license law. “Bein’ fr’ the
city, as you be,” said the landlord, lowering
his voice to a whisper, and placing
his heavy hand on Archibald’s shoulder
familiarly, “I calc’late you’re cold an’
ready for a tidy drink. I calc’late I’m
talkin’ to a gent as is used ter lickerin’
up, even ef ’tis agin the law?” To humor
him, Archibald admitted that he had
no stringent prohibitory sentiments.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well then, good! Jest you foller
me!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Archibald followed the landlord out into
the hotel yard, where the latter pulled
up the flaps of a cellar-door. Hearing
the creaking sound, and taking it for an
admonitory signal, the row of men on the
hotel piazza, who had resumed their seats,
again dropped their feet on the floor, rose,
and came out into the yard in Indian file,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>in perfect silence. Archibald followed
his landlord down into the darkness of the
cellar, where, beneath the dim light of a
solitary candle he perceived a cask with a
wooden spigot, and near it half a dozen
tin cups. The men filed down the steps
behind him. “You’ve heerd o’ apple
jack?” asked the landlord, in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c010'>Archibald nodded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Drink that, then!” and the landlord
handed him a cupful of the beverage. It
was enough to intoxicate him. He drank
but a very little; as he saw the other men
were waiting, he passed the cup on to
them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Welcome to East Village, stranger,”
said one of the men, drinking. “Be you
up ’ere a-sellin’ marchandize?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, no!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Be you come to see the Squar’?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well—perhaps—yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wa’l, this is a dead give away!” and
the men laughed noisily, as rustics will.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>“Don’t mention this ’ere cider to Squar’
Price!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The next morning was delicious, the
air clear and smelling of the mountains.
The mist hung above the distant river,
and a line of hills showed their green
wooded outline above it. As Archibald
breathed the sweet country air, he stepped
more briskly, felt less of his city malaria,
drew into his lungs a long breath of the
fresh, invigorating summer wind, which
seemed to come to him across the high
upland, from such a vast distance.</p>

<p class='c010'>He came to the old colonial gate and
entered. The Hon. Ephraim B. Price was
just at the moment sauntering down the
gravel path from his house to his law
office. As he saw Archibald enter, he
came forward somewhat more rapidly.
He was a man of large frame, gaunt
rather than spare, of prominent cheekbones,
of lengthy chin-beard. His eyes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>were very keen, and his entire expression
was one of patient alertness—as if there
was very little to be alert over, but a deep
necessity of keeping up a reputation.
Archibald learned afterward how indefatigable
a partisan, and how strenuous
a believer in the Republican party the
Hon. Ephraim was.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sir,” he said, after greeting Archibald,
and looking with a grin of pity upon
his engraved card—a grin directed chiefly
to the “Mr.” before Archibald’s name—“you
are Elvira’s landlord down to New
York—tell me, how is your city and State
going, do you think?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Archibald felt taken aback. Politics
were something of which he knew nothing.
He was but barely aware that it was
a presidential year. In the city he kept
severely out of politics, as hardly the employment
of gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I—I—think it will go Democratic.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A more violent frown than before. “If
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>I thought so, sir; if I imagined so; if
for one instant I believed that what we
fought for during the war—Eh, Elvira?
Here is Mr. Archibald!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then the Hon. Ephraim turned abruptly
and entered his office, where, it may
be added, he sat for the next hour, his
feet on the cold stove before him, meditating
where his next fee was to come
from, and breaking out with an occasional
invective against the wicked democracy.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before the old gentleman was a square
window which looked out over the town.
All day long he sat before this, as upon a
watch-tower—a censor of village morals
and deportment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Father is so interested in the election,”
apologized Elvira. “But how
strange to see you here; and I told you
not to!”</p>

<p class='c010'>She held a small gray kitten in her
arms, which she stroked slowly. She was
still in his favorite white muslin, and she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>had a gentle, sweet flush of pleasure in
her face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I came, Miss Price—because—don’t
you know—I—aw—missed you,” and he
smiled.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are very good. How is Aunt
Perkins? Did she bring her mission boys
to your house? She has written that a
friend of yours has given fifty dollars for
the boys. Do tell me about it. Is she
well? Have any more boarders come?”</p>

<p class='c010'>She plied him with questions as they
strolled toward the white-pillared portico.
The house was old and shabby, but he
did not notice it. The place was run
down and impoverished, but it seemed
very beautiful to him, for he noticed that
she wore one of his roses in her lustrous
hair.</p>

<p class='c010'>Entering the hallway he met some of
the younger brothers and sisters, and felt
a sudden strange affection spring up in
his heart for them. Elvira took him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>through into a gloomy parlor, lined with
plain hair-cloth furniture. On the walls
were several portraits. “This was my
mother,” said the girl, affectionately,
pointing to what Archibald felt to be
a hideous daub, a red-faced woman in
black, against a green background. It
was the portrait by Mr. Raymond, whose
abode was now the poor-house. “She
died only two years ago——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I fancy if she had lived,” said Archibald,
“you would not have tried—the
stage?”</p>

<p class='c010'>She looked at him calmly a moment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That Boston man has told you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I learned the fact from his
friends.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall never—again.” There was a
despairing pathos in her voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Elvira,” he said, slowly, “as I see it—I
think it was very noble of you to try.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then, unaccountably to him, she burst
into tears.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>“It is what I love—what I long for—to
be an actress—a great actress,” she
sobbed. “But I can’t—I can’t! I can’t
exist with those creatures—those horrible
men who hang about you! No one knows
what I endured! No one knows what,
too, I gave up when I left the stage and
came home; but I <i>had</i> to.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He leaned forward in sympathy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You may say what you will, but there
is no Art like acting, and nothing so fine
as applause. Oh, that I could bring myself
to do it—to be strong enough to do it—to
save our fortunes—to help father.
You little know how I have suffered, Mr.
Archibald.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“By Jove—I—I quite like you for it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>He was on his feet at her side. Impulsively
he bent down and whispered close
to her ear. “Let me be your audience
the rest of my life! Act for <i>me</i>—let me
applaud everything—anything you do,
my darling! always! always!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>She put him away.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t feel I have acted just right
<i>with</i> you,” she said. “I should have told
you that I was—or might be again—an
actress.” She spoke coldly. “I don’t
believe you want them in your boarding-house.
They are not always desirable,
I believe!” Elvira’s eyes were fastened
on the floor.</p>

<p class='c010'>Archibald paced to and fro in the parlor.
“Confound her odd New England
conscience!” he muttered to himself.
Seizing her hands, he cried, passionately,
“I, too, must confess. Elvira, I loved
you that first day you came. <i>I loved you!</i>
Therefore I let you think—it <i>was</i> a boarding
house.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And it isn’t—it’s your own private—Oh,
Mr. Archibald!”</p>

<p class='c010'>She sat and looked at him with a horrified
stare. The full truth of his imposition
began to steal upon her gradually.
Then her face fell and she averted it, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>she felt that a fatal untruth had come between
them. She rose quietly and left
him standing near her. She went upstairs
to her room and threw herself upon
her bed in an agony of tears.</p>

<p class='c010'>Through it all Archibald had merely
smiled!</p>

<h3 class='c015'>VIII.</h3>

<p class='c016'>But when she left him he felt rather
weak for a moment, as if his city malaria
had returned upon him with a double
force. As Elvira showed no signs of returning,
he amused himself by turning
over the leaves of the family photograph
album. Face by face revealed the stern,
set, arid, Puritan features, the hard, determined
chins, and the “firmness,” which,
in the person of the Hon. Ephraim, he
felt still dominated and controlled the
public affairs of East Village. He threw
down the album with a feeling of impotent
rage against the survival of this colonial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>“narrowness,” as he liked to call
it. He walked out of the house and wandered,
much crestfallen and full of malaria,
along the village street toward the
hotel. A great many farm wagons were
tied along the sidewalk, and there were
numbers of fresh-cheeked country girls
walking in threes and fours, and sweeping
the sidewalk as they went. Upon a slight
elevation stood a white wooden meetinghouse,
with a white steeple, and it gave
him a chill even on that warm morning
to look at it—it <i>looked</i> so cold. Small
groups of hard-featured farmers in fur
caps stood on the corners of the streets
discussing, presumably, the crops. He
wondered if the fur caps were needed in
that arid, bleak region to keep warm the
natives’ sense of Right and Wrong? He
made his way out, beneath some beautiful
elms, into a small, old-fashioned burying-ground,
where he discovered that “erring
sinners” apparently comprised the only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>element of those who were requested to
“<i>Pause and Read</i>.” Feeling himself to
be now, for some reason, a distinctly immoral
person, he read some of the quaint
epitaphs, to which he was invited, in a
spirit of humility, which presently changed
to amusement. In death as in life, the
hard, stern old village characters preserved
on their headstones a fund of grim
humor for the “sinner,” which in Archibald’s
instance made him smile. “Oh,”
he sighed to himself, “I long to take her
away from all this sort of thing—forever!”</p>

<p class='c010'>He took a long walk in the afternoon,
and returned to the hotel to find a coldly
worded note from Elvira inviting him
around to tea. He removed the stains of
his walk, and dressed himself with his
usual care. He found Elvira waiting for
him beneath the high white pillars, in an
unbecoming, and as it seemed to him, forbidding
dress of black. Her face seemed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>unusually stern and relentless. There
were traces of tears in her red eyelids,
but the tears were dried away now, and
her eyes were very bright and hard.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t say anything <i>now</i>. Father feels
very deeply about it. We have had a
long talk. When he heard of the—of the
unfortunate house affair—he was <i>so</i> angry
I could hardly pacify him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Archibald’s heart sank within him. He
fairly shivered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He said that he did not want me to
lower my standard,” continued Elvira, in
her clear, musical, passionless voice.
“And I told him that he need have no
fears. I wanted to see you first, and tell
you. Let us not have any <i>feeling</i> about it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Any <i>feeling</i>!” exclaimed Archibald.
“Why—how can we help it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let us act as if we had never understood
one another. I will go back to the
city with you, and Aunt Perkins and I will
find some other place at once.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>“Go back with me—and expect me to
show no feeling! Elvira, this is preposterous!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I will go back alone.” She
compressed her lips, just as he had observed
her father do.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I beg pardon, Elvira, do you mean—can
you mean that I can never—I can
never hope!”</p>

<p class='c010'>She nodded her pretty flower-like head
gravely. “Come in to tea, won’t you?”
she said, coolly. “I want father to hear
you talk about Art.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He turned on his heel. At last he, too,
was angry.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thanks, awfully,” he said. “But if I
go back to the hotel now, I shall just have
time to pack my valise and catch the
evening train.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He walked rapidly away, leaving her
standing upon the white-pillared portico,
looking with pure, sweet, upturned face,
like a saint who has for all time renounced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>the world, the flesh, and the devil. Had
he looked back, Mr. Jerome Archibald’s
tender heart would have been touched by
her attitude; he would have returned,
and, against her will, clasped her in his
arms and covered her pale lips with warm
kisses. It might have melted her high
“standard” a little. But he let a night
intervene without seeing her, and the entering
wedge of her high sense of duty did
its work before morning. He determined
to remain another day and make a further
trial. When he called the next day she
was obdurate. “Love cannot be built
upon deceit and untruth,” she said, sententiously.
“I was not frank, you were
not. It is better that we should part. I
could never hold up my head—I could
never face the world. I know what they
would call me. They would call me an
<i>adventuress!</i> and they would hate me for
being successful. Yes—your mother,
your sisters—everyone.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>“But you were perfectly innocent about
it, Elvira.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a little pause.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I, too, was innocent. I meant no
more than to have you near me, where I
could learn to know you—love you—and
now, really, it seems as if you had built
up a mountain of ice between us, don’t
you know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She merely shook her head.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Archibald returned to the city
his malaria compelled him to go away
again almost immediately to Newport.
There, a few weeks later, his agent wrote
him that he had succeeded in renting the
house “at an exorbitant figure to a very
rich tenant without children”—thus fulfilling
his mother’s conditions to the letter.
He went back to the city, recovered in
health, to pack up a few personal effects,
and found to his surprise that Miss Perkins
and her niece were, at the moment
he arrived, in the house. They had taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>board on Ninth Street, and had gone
up to take a last look of the charming
interior where, Elvira guiltily acknowledged,
life had been “so wrongly pleasant.”
He found Elvira holding a fan in
her hand and seated pensively in an old
Venetian chair in what was formerly her
studio. As he entered the room she rose,
blushing a most vivid red, and as rapidly
turning pale again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Archibald!” she exclaimed. “I
did not know you were in the city!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have been here only an hour,” he
said, stiffly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is time for us to go;” and she
turned to the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Elvira!” His face looked sick and
ghastly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well?” She drew herself up very
coldly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you made of stone?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Archibald, what can you mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My child, you are capable of grinding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>one who loves you into powder—like—er—a
millstone!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Aunt Perkins!” she called out, “let
us go!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” he cried, “I will not let you go.
You shall hear me! I love you! Do you
hear? And you shall not leave this house
until you say you will be my wife! I
know you care for me—everything tells
me so—but you will wear your own and
my heart out with your hard, cruel conscience!
What brought you here? <i>You
loved me!</i> Why have you been sitting in
this room? You love me, Elvira—I know
it—I feel it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gently he drew her to him and kissed
her. She laid her head on his shoulder
and breathed a little contented sigh. “<i>I
don’t think this—is right!</i>” she said.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>The view from Mrs. Manstey’s
window was not a
striking one, but to her at
least it was full of interest
and beauty. Mrs. Manstey
occupied the back
room on the third floor of
a New York boarding-house,
in a street where
the ash-barrels lingered
late on the sidewalk and
the gaps in the pavement
would have staggered a Quintus
Curtius. She was the widow of a clerk
in a large wholesale house, and his death
had left her alone, for her only daughter
had married in California, and could
not afford the long journey to New York
to see her mother. Mrs. Manstey, perhaps,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>might have joined her daughter
in the West, but they had now been so
many years apart that they had ceased to
feel any need of each other’s society, and
their intercourse had long been limited to
the exchange of a few perfunctory letters,
written with indifference by the daughter,
and with difficulty by Mrs. Manstey,
whose right hand was growing stiff with
gout. Even had she felt a stronger desire
for her daughter’s companionship, Mrs.
Manstey’s increasing infirmity, which
caused her to dread the three flights of
stairs between her room and the street,
would have given her pause on the eve of
undertaking so long a journey; and without,
perhaps, formulating these reasons
she had long since accepted as a matter of
course her solitary life in New York.</p>

<p class='c010'>She was, indeed, not quite lonely, for a
few friends still toiled up now and then to
her room; but their visits grew rare as the
years went by. Mrs. Manstey had never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>been a sociable woman, and during her
husband’s lifetime his companionship had
been all-sufficient to her. For many years
she had cherished a desire to live in the
country, to have a hen-house and a garden;
but this longing had faded with age,
leaving only in the breast of the uncommunicative
old woman a vague tenderness
for plants and animals. It was, perhaps,
this tenderness which made her cling so
fervently to the view from her window, a
view in which the most optimistic eye
would at first have failed to discover
anything admirable.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Manstey, from her coign of vantage
(a slightly projecting bow-window
where she nursed an ivy and a succession
of unwholesome-looking bulbs), looked
out first upon the yard of her own dwelling,
of which, however, she could get but
a restricted glimpse. Still, her gaze took
in the topmost boughs of the ailanthus below
her window, and she knew how early
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>each year the clump of dicentra strung its
bending stalk with hearts of pink.</p>

<p class='c010'>But of greater interest were the yards
beyond. Being for the most part attached
to boarding-houses they were in a state of
chronic untidiness and fluttering, on certain
days of the week, with miscellaneous
garments and frayed table-cloths. In
spite of this Mrs. Manstey found much to
admire in the long vista which she commanded.
Some of the yards were, indeed,
but stony wastes, with grass in the
cracks of the pavement and no shade in
spring save that afforded by the intermittent
leafage of the clothes-lines. These
yards Mrs. Manstey disapproved of, but
the others, the green ones, she loved.
She had grown used to their disorder; the
broken barrels, the empty bottles and
paths unswept no longer annoyed her;
hers was the happy faculty of dwelling on
the pleasanter side of the prospect before
her.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>
<img src='images/i_191.jpg' alt='[Magnolia]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In the very next enclosure did not a
magnolia open its hard white flowers
against the watery blue of April? And
was there not, a little way down the line,
a fence foamed over every May by lilac
waves of wistaria? Farther still, a
horse-chestnut lifted its candelabra
of buff and pink blossoms
above broad fans of foliage;
while in the opposite yard
June was sweet with the
breath of a neglected syringa,
which persisted in
growing in spite of the
countless obstacles opposed
to its welfare.</p>

<p class='c010'>But if nature occupied
the front rank in Mrs.
Manstey’s view, there
was much of a more personal
character to interest
her in the aspect of
the houses and their inmates.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>She deeply disapproved of the
mustard-colored curtains which had lately
been hung in the doctor’s window opposite;
but she glowed with pleasure
when the house farther down had its old
bricks washed with a coat of paint. The
occupants of the houses did not often
show themselves at the back windows,
but the servants were always in sight.
Noisy slatterns, Mrs. Manstey pronounced
the greater number; she knew
their ways and hated them. But to the
quiet cook in the newly painted house,
whose mistress bullied her, and who
secretly fed the stray cats at nightfall,
Mrs. Manstey’s warmest sympathies were
given. On one occasion her feelings
were racked by the neglect of a housemaid,
who for two days forgot to feed
the parrot committed to her care. On
the third day, Mrs. Manstey, in spite of
her gouty hand, had just penned a letter,
beginning: “Madam, it is now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>three days since your parrot has been
fed,” when the forgetful maid appeared
at the window with a cup of seed in her
hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>But in Mrs. Manstey’s more meditative
moods it was the narrowing perspective
of far-off yards which pleased
her best. She loved, at twilight, when
the distant brown-stone spire seemed
melting in the fluid yellow of the west,
to lose herself in vague memories of a
trip to Europe, made years ago, and now
reduced in her mind’s eye to a pale
phantasmagoria of indistinct steeples
and dreamy skies. Perhaps at heart
Mrs. Manstey was an artist; at all events
she was sensible of many changes of
color unnoticed by the average eye, and
dear to her as the green of early spring
was the black lattice of branches against
a cold sulphur sky at the close of a
snowy day. She enjoyed, also, the sunny
thaws of March, when patches of earth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>showed through the snow, like ink-spots
spreading on a sheet of white blotting-paper;
and, better still, the haze of
boughs, leafless but swollen, which replaced
the clear-cut tracery of winter.
She even watched with a certain interest
the trail of smoke from a far-off factory
chimney, and missed a detail in the
landscape when the factory was closed
and the smoke disappeared.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Manstey, in the long hours which
she spent at her window, was not idle.
She read a little, and knitted numberless
stockings; but the view surrounded and
shaped her life as the sea does a lonely
island. When her rare callers came it
was difficult for her to detach herself
from the contemplation of the opposite
window-washing, or the scrutiny of certain
green points in a neighboring flowerbed
which might, or might not, turn
into hyacinths, while she feigned an interest
in her visitor’s anecdotes about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>some unknown grandchild. Mrs. Manstey’s
real friends were the denizens of
the yards, the hyacinths, the magnolia,
the green parrot, the maid who fed the
cats, the doctor who studied late behind
his mustard-colored curtains; and the
confidant of her tenderer musings was
the church-spire floating in the sunset.</p>

<p class='c010'>One April day, as she sat in her usual
place, with knitting cast aside and eyes
fixed on the blue sky mottled with round
clouds, a knock at the door announced
the entrance of her landlady. Mrs. Manstey
did not care for her landlady, but
she submitted to her visits with ladylike
resignation. To-day, however, it seemed
harder than usual to turn from the blue
sky and the blossoming magnolia to Mrs.
Sampson’s unsuggestive face, and Mrs.
Manstey was conscious of a distinct effort
as she did so.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The magnolia is out earlier than usual
this year, Mrs. Sampson,” she remarked,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>yielding to a rare impulse, for she seldom
alluded to the absorbing interest of her
life. In the first place it was a topic not
likely to appeal to her visitors and, besides,
she lacked the power of expression
and could not have given utterance to her
feelings had she wished to.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The what, Mrs. Manstey?” inquired
the landlady, glancing about the room as
if to find there the explanation of Mrs.
Manstey’s statement.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The magnolia in the next yard—in
Mrs. Black’s yard,” Mrs. Manstey repeated.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is it, indeed? I didn’t know there
was a magnolia there,” said Mrs. Sampson,
carelessly. Mrs. Manstey looked at
her; she did not know that there was a
magnolia in the next yard!</p>

<p class='c010'>“By the way,” Mrs. Sampson continued,
“speaking of Mrs. Black reminds me
that the work on the extension is to begin
next week.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>“The what?” it was Mrs. Manstey’s
turn to ask.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The extension,” said Mrs. Sampson,
nodding her head in the direction of the
ignored magnolia. “You knew, of
course, that Mrs. Black was going to build
an extension to her house? Yes, ma’am,
I hear it is to run right back to the end of
the yard. How she can afford to build
an extension in these hard times I don’t
see; but she always was crazy about
building. She used to keep a boarding-house
in Seventeenth Street, and she nearly
ruined herself then by sticking out bow-windows
and what not; I should have
thought that would have cured her of building,
but I guess it’s a disease, like drink.
Anyhow, the work is to begin on Monday.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Manstey had grown pale. She
always spoke slowly, so the landlady did
not heed the long pause which followed.
At last Mrs. Manstey said: “Do you
know how high the extension will be?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>“That’s the most absurd part of it.
The extension is to be built right up to
the roof of the main building; now, did
you ever?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Manstey paused again. “Won’t
it be a great annoyance to you, Mrs.
Sampson?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should say it would. But there’s no
help for it; if people have got a mind to
build extensions there’s no law to prevent
’em, that I’m aware of.” Mrs. Manstey,
knowing this, was silent. “There is no
help for it,” Mrs. Sampson repeated,
“but if I <i>am</i> a church member, I wouldn’t
be so sorry if it ruined Eliza Black. Well,
good-day, Mrs. Manstey; I’m glad to
find you so comfortable.”</p>

<p class='c010'>So comfortable—so comfortable! Left
to herself the old woman turned once
more to the window. How lovely the
view was that day! The blue sky with
its round clouds shed a brightness over
everything; the ailanthus had put on a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>tinge of yellow-green, the hyacinths were
budding, the magnolia flowers looked
more than ever like rosettes carved in
alabaster. Soon the wistaria would
bloom, then the horse-chestnut; but not
for her. Between her eyes and them a
barrier of brick and mortar would swiftly
rise; presently even the spire would disappear,
and all her radiant world be
blotted out. Mrs. Manstey sent away
untouched the dinner-tray brought to her
that evening. She lingered in the window
until the windy sunset died in bat-colored
dusk; then, going to bed, she lay sleepless
all night.</p>

<p class='c010'>Early the next day she was up and at
the window. It was raining, but even
through the slanting gray gauze the scene
had its charm—and then the rain was so
good for the trees. She had noticed the
day before that the ailanthus was growing
dusty.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course I might move,” said Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>Manstey aloud, and turning from the window
she looked about her room. She
might move, of course; so might she be
flayed alive; but she was not likely to
survive either operation. The room,
though far less important to her happiness
than the view, was as much a part of her
existence. She had lived in it seventeen
years. She knew every stain on the wallpaper,
every rent in the carpet; the light
fell in a certain way on her engravings,
her books had grown shabby on their
shelves, her bulbs and ivy were used to
their window and knew which way to lean
to the sun. “We are all too old to
move,” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>That afternoon it cleared. Wet and
radiant the blue reappeared through torn
rags of cloud; the ailanthus sparkled; the
earth in the flower-borders looked rich and
warm. It was Thursday, and on Monday
the building of the extension was to begin.</p>

<p class='c010'>On Sunday afternoon a card was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>brought to Mrs. Black, as she was engaged
in gathering up the fragments of
the boarders’ dinner in the basement.
The card, black-edged, bore Mrs. Manstey’s
name.</p>

<p class='c010'>“One of Mrs. Sampson’s boarders;
wants to move, I suppose. Well, I can
give her a room next year in the extension.
Dinah,” said Mrs. Black, “tell the
lady I’ll be upstairs in a minute.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Black found Mrs. Manstey standing
in the long parlor garnished with
statuettes and antimacassars; in that
house she could not sit down.</p>

<p class='c010'>Stooping hurriedly to open the register,
which let out a cloud of dust, Mrs. Black
advanced to her visitor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m happy to meet you, Mrs. Manstey;
take a seat, please,” the landlady
remarked in her prosperous voice, the
voice of a woman who can afford to build
extensions. There was no help for it;
Mrs. Manstey sat down.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>“Is there anything I can do for you,
ma’am?” Mrs. Black continued. “My
house is full at present, but I am going
to build an extension, and——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is about the extension that I wish
to speak,” said Mrs. Manstey, suddenly.
“I am a poor woman, Mrs. Black, and I
have never been a happy one. I shall
have to talk about myself first to—to
make you understand.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Black, astonished but imperturbable,
bowed at this parenthesis.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I never had what I wanted,” Mrs.
Manstey continued. “It was always
one disappointment after another. For
years I wanted to live in the country. I
dreamed and dreamed about it; but we
never could manage it. There was no
sunny window in our house, and so all
my plants died. My daughter married
years ago and went away—besides, she
never cared for the same things. Then
my husband died and I was left alone.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>That was seventeen years ago. I went
to live at Mrs. Sampson’s, and I have
been there ever since. I have grown a
little infirm, as you see, and I don’t get
out often; only on fine days, if I am feeling
very well. So you can understand
my sitting a great deal in my window—the
back window on the third floor——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, Mrs. Manstey,” said Mrs.
Black, liberally, “I could give you a
back room, I dare say; one of the new
rooms in the ex——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I don’t want to move; I can’t
move,” said Mrs. Manstey, almost with
a scream. “And I came to tell you that
if you build that extension I shall have no
view from my window—no view! Do you
understand?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Black thought herself face to face
with a lunatic, and she had always heard
that lunatics must be humored.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear me, dear me,” she remarked,
pushing her chair back a little way, “that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>is too bad, isn’t it? Why, I never
thought of that. To be sure, the extension
<i>will</i> interfere with your view, Mrs.
Manstey.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You do understand?” Mrs. Manstey
gasped.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course I do. And I’m real sorry
about it, too. But there, don’t you worry,
Mrs. Manstey. I guess we can fix
that all right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Manstey rose from her seat, and
Mrs. Black slipped toward the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you mean by fixing it? Do
you mean that I can induce you to change
your mind about the extension? Oh, Mrs.
Black, listen to me. I have two thousand
dollars in the bank and I could manage,
I know I could manage, to give you a
thousand if——” Mrs. Manstey paused;
the tears were rolling down her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There, there, Mrs. Manstey, don’t
you worry,” repeated Mrs. Black, soothingly.
“I am sure we can settle it. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>am sorry that I can’t stay and talk about
it any longer, but this is such a busy
time of day, with supper to get——”</p>

<p class='c010'>Her hand was on the door-knob, but
with sudden vigor Mrs. Manstey seized
her wrist.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are not giving me a definite answer.
Do you mean to say that you accept
my proposition?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, I’ll think it over, Mrs. Manstey,
certainly I will. I wouldn’t annoy
you for the world——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But the work is to begin to-morrow, I
am told,” Mrs. Manstey persisted.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Black hesitated. “It shan’t begin,
I promise you that; I’ll send word
to the builder this very night.” Mrs.
Manstey tightened her hold.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are not deceiving me, are you?”
she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No—no,” stammered Mrs. Black.
“How can you think such a thing of me,
Mrs. Manstey?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Slowly Mrs. Manstey’s clutch relaxed,
and she passed through the open door.
“One thousand dollars,” she repeated,
pausing in the hall; then she let herself
out of the house and hobbled down the
steps, supporting herself on the cast-iron
railing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My goodness,” exclaimed Mrs. Black,
shutting and bolting the hall-door, “I
never knew the old woman was crazy!
And she looks so quiet and ladylike,
too.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Manstey slept well that night, but
early the next morning she was awakened
by a sound of hammering. She got to
her window with what haste she might
and, looking out, saw that Mrs. Black’s
yard was full of workmen. Some were
carrying loads of brick from the kitchen
to the yard, others beginning to demolish
the old-fashioned wooden balcony which
adorned each story of Mrs. Black’s house.
Mrs. Manstey saw that she had been deceived.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>At first she thought of confiding
her trouble to Mrs. Sampson, but a settled
discouragement soon took possession
of her and she went back to bed, not caring
to see what was going on.</p>

<p class='c010'>Toward afternoon, however, feeling
that she must know the worst, she rose
and dressed herself. It was a laborious
task, for her hands were stiffer than usual,
and the hooks and buttons seemed to
evade her.</p>

<p class='c010'>When she seated herself in the window,
she saw that the workmen had removed
the upper part of the balcony, and that
the bricks had multiplied since morning.
One of the men, a coarse fellow with a
bloated face, picked a magnolia blossom
and, after smelling it, threw it to the
ground; the next man, carrying a load of
bricks, trod on the flower in passing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look out, Jim,” called one of the
men to another who was smoking a pipe,
“if you throw matches around near those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>barrels of paper you’ll have the old tinder-box
burning down before you know
it.” And Mrs. Manstey, leaning forward,
perceived that there were several barrels
of paper and rubbish under the wooden
balcony.</p>

<p class='c010'>At length the work ceased and twilight
fell. The sunset was perfect and a roseate
light, transfiguring the distant spire,
lingered late in the west. When it grew
dark Mrs. Manstey drew down the shades
and proceeded, in her usual methodical
manner, to light her lamp. She always
filled and lit it with her own hands, keeping
a kettle of kerosene on a zinc-covered
shelf in a closet. As the lamp-light filled
the room it assumed its peaceful aspect.
The books and pictures and plants
seemed, like their mistress, to settle themselves
down for another quiet evening,
and Mrs. Manstey, as was her wont, drew
up her armchair to the table and began to
knit.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>That night she could not sleep. The
weather had changed and a wild wind
was abroad, blotting the stars with close-driven
clouds. Mrs. Manstey rose once or
twice and looked out of the window; but
of the view nothing was discernible save a
tardy light or two in the opposite windows.
These lights at last went out, and
Mrs. Manstey, who had watched for their
extinction, began to dress herself. She
was in evident haste, for she merely flung
a thin dressing-gown over her night-dress
and wrapped her head in a scarf; then
she opened her closet and cautiously took
out the kettle of kerosene. Having slipped
a bundle of wooden matches into her
pocket she proceeded, with increasing
precautions, to unlock her door, and a
few moments later she was feeling her
way down the dark staircase, led by a
glimmer of gas from the lower hall. At
length she reached the bottom of the
stairs and began the more difficult descent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>into the utter darkness of the basement.
Here, however, she could move more
freely, as there was less danger of being
overheard; and without much delay she
contrived to unlock the iron door leading
into the yard. A gust of cold wind smote
her as she stepped out and groped shiveringly
under the clothes-lines.</p>

<p class='c010'>That morning at three o’clock an alarm
of fire brought the engines to Mrs. Black’s
door, and also brought Mrs. Sampson’s
startled boarders to their windows. The
wooden balcony at the back of Mrs.
Black’s house was ablaze, and among
those who watched the progress of the
flames was Mrs. Manstey, leaning in her
thin dressing-gown from the open window.</p>

<p class='c010'>The fire, however, was soon put out,
and the frightened occupants of the
house, who had fled in scant attire, reassembled
at dawn to find that little mischief
had been done beyond the cracking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>of window panes and smoking of ceilings.
In fact, the chief sufferer by the fire was
Mrs. Manstey, who was found in the
morning gasping with pneumonia, a not
unnatural result, as everyone remarked,
of her having hung out of an open window
at her age in a dressing-gown. It was
easy to see that she was very ill, but no
one had guessed how grave the doctor’s
verdict would be, and the faces gathered
that evening about Mrs. Sampson’s table
were awe-struck and disturbed. Not that
any of the boarders knew Mrs. Manstey
well; she “kept to herself,” as they said,
and seemed to fancy herself too good for
them; but then it is always disagreeable
to have anyone dying in the house, and,
as one lady observed to another: “It
might just as well have been you or me,
my dear.”</p>

<img src='images/i_212.jpg' alt='[Woman]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>But it was only Mrs. Manstey; and she
was dying, as she had lived, lonely if not
alone. The doctor had sent a trained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>nurse, and Mrs. Sampson, with
muffled step, came in from
time to time; but both, to Mrs.
Manstey, seemed remote
and unsubstantial as the
figures in a dream. All
day she said nothing; but
when she was asked
for her daughter’s address
she shook her
head. At times the
nurse noticed that she
seemed to be listening
attentively for some
sound which did not
come; then again she
dozed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next morning at
daylight she was very
low. The nurse called Mrs. Sampson,
and as the two bent over the old woman
they saw her lips move.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Lift me up—out of bed,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>They raised her in their arms, and with
her stiff hand she pointed to the window.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, the window—she wants to sit in
the window. She used to sit there all
day,” Mrs. Sampson explained. “It can
do her no harm, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing matters now,” said the nurse.</p>

<p class='c010'>They carried Mrs. Manstey to the window
and placed her in her chair. The
dawn was abroad, a jubilant spring
dawn; the spire had already caught a
golden ray, though the magnolia and
horse-chestnut still slumbered in shadow.
In Mrs. Black’s yard all was quiet. The
charred timbers of the balcony lay where
they had fallen. It was evident that since
the fire the builders had not returned to
their work. The magnolia had unfolded
a few more sculptural flowers; the view
was undisturbed.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was hard for Mrs. Manstey to
breathe. Each moment it grew more difficult.
She tried to make them open the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>window, but they would not understand.
If she could have tasted the air, sweet
with the penetrating ailanthus savor, it
would have eased her; but the view at
least was there—the spire was golden
now, the heavens had warmed from pearl
to blue, day was alight from east to west,
even the magnolia had caught the sun.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Manstey’s head fell back, and
smiling she died.</p>

<p class='c010'>That day the building of the extension
was resumed.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this series of little books, issued under the

attractive subjects and decorated by a few illustrations
to brighten the pages.</p>

made to secure an example of book-making as
dainty and perfect as possible.</p>
